<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 12.55pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; margin: 0cm 56.0pt .0001pt 0cm;">Braham opened the oratorio most excellently, but these were his last notes, he was heard no more. Caradori sung well &ldquo;Rejoice greatly;&rdquo; but though a brilliant song (and it was her only one), it did not show her talents to the best advantage. The recitative, &ldquo;There were shepherds,&rdquo; was allotted to Mrs. W.- Knyvett; the air &ldquo;Come unto Him,&rdquo;' to Madame Stockhausen ; and &ldquo;I know that my Redeemer liveth,&rdquo; to Miss Stephens, but she had nothing more. It is difficult to imagine why she had so little; she ought certainly to have delivered the recitative above mentioned, as she would have done so with greater excellence, though even she might have been inferior to Mara, whose distinctness of articulation, though a foreigner, surpassed greatly that of the native who executed it. The last song named is much the finest in the oratorio, but, though well sung, the effect it produced was by no means equal to that described by Dr. Burney in the passage quoted above, nor was it to be expected; Miss Stephens never had as much expression as her great predecessor, nor could excite as much feeling in her hearers, but there appeared little diminution of her powers in this performance.</p>
