### has_evidence_text


I COMMENCED my duties at the Abbey in 1875, after the Summer holidays, being well received by my predecessor, James Turle, who still retained his title of Organist, and, as I have said, continued to live in his house in the Cloisters. This welcome was all the more acceptable to me, inasmuch as he had been assisted for some years by a clever pupil (who afterwards became
organist of the Chapel Royal Charles Jekyll) who possibly he had hoped might have succeeded him. He never interfered with my work in any way, or proffered
any but the kindest criticism and counsel. During the few years he spent in his retirement from active work, I can truly say I did all in my power to add to the comfort of his days, and when occasion arose I would seek the benefit of his advice. [...] 

Turle played the service now and then, the last time being on June 28th, 1880, the anniversary of the Coronation of Queen Victoria. When he played out with the National Anthem, I remember saying to a friend, "I feel this is the last time the dear old man will play in the Abbey"; and so it was. He died on June 28th, 1882.
