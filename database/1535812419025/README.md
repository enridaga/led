<p class="MsoNormal">Perfectly am I aware of the magical power of associated ideas, of whose relative connection we are sometimes anxious, but oftener, as you admirably observe, are unable to trace, or define it. Those pleasurable sensations are especially linked to verses, and to musical airs, and most forcibly when verse and music have, in union, seized upon our attention during seasons of happiness. Many a silly song, with which my ear had been familiar in my childhood and rising youth, does at this hour, on recurrence, act upon my nerves with great luxury of sensation, though I do not impute the luxury to any merit in that which produced it. We may consider such fascinating ditties as does the lover his mistress, when, without beauty, grace, or talents, she has infatuated his passions.&mdash;A not very uncommon witchery.</p>
