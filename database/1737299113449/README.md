It raised some Alarm you may be sure in the Fear of its spreading to the Rest, &amp; it took up so many hands in putting it out or rather in preventing its gaining on (as it burnt down that Single Piece) that the Firework was at a Stand, &amp; what was let off after that was Irregular &amp; in Confusion. The Illumination too which should have been done all at Once was performed but by Bits at a Time which quite spoilt the Effect, &amp; when lighted it was not at last so pretty as an Opera-Scene. So that the whole Diversion was as Miss Talbot described it last Night, an Irregular Incompleat Whole consisting of several very Beautiful Parts. I could not help being concern'd last Night as a good English-Woman, that these Rejoicings we have made such a Rout with, which were to outdo those of all Other Nations, &amp; that so many Foreigners were present at; which have lost so much Time &amp; cost so much Money (they say 15000 &pound;) should have failed in any Degree: but I was heartily thankful we all escaped so well from them. I believe you hardly envy me my Diversion though it was certainly a fine One.</span></p>
