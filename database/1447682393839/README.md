<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">In the late 50s I came here to attend a Polish "Harvest Festival" Ball organised by the London Polish community. I was in a Polish Folk Dance Group at the time and we were invited to demonstrate one of our dances and to join in the general dancing. It was a wonderful evening, ending at 5am. I do remember that the pillars seemed odd things to have dotted round a dance floor! I now live in New Zealand and always come here when I visit London.</p>
