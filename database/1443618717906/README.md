<p>The Festival of Britain caused great excitement. I was a ninteen year old working in Regent Street, after work on the Sats several of us went to the Sth Bank Exhibition. We were fortunate and got tickets for the May 19th concert of the London Welsh Association, Sir Adrian Boult conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra and the Welsh Choir. The Hall so modern and different and breathtaking. I shall never forget the thick fog on the night of the Fords Works Band Concert, we sat in the front row, Gwen Catley was on the Programme, and it was difficult for her to sing, the fog was inside the Hall as well, finding our way back to Charing Cross Station and Hornchurch was grim. Late after I was married we enjoyed the early evening organ recitals and several other concerts.</p>
