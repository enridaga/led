### value


<p>Arthur [Artur] Rubinstein's last performance was unforgettable. Cannot remember date but I have rarely seen such a wonderful and well deserved ovation - spine tingling! There were other superb occasions. My life would have lost out greatly without the pleasure I have had at the RFH.</p>
