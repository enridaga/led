<p>[Marchesi&rsquo;s] vocal powers were very great, his voice of extensive compass, but a little inclined to be thick. His execution was very considerable, and he was rather too fond of displaying it; nor was his cantabile singing equal to his bravura. In recitative and scenes of energy and passion, he was incom&shy;parable, and had he been less lavish of orna&shy;ments, which were not always appropriate, and possessed a more pure and simple taste, his performance would have been faultless: it was always striking, animated, and effective. He chose for his d&eacute;but Sarti&rsquo;s beautiful opera of Giulio Sabino, in which all the songs of the principal character, and they are many and various, are of the very finest description. But I was a little disappointed at Marchesi&rsquo;s execution of them, for they were all familiar to me, as I had repeatedly heard Pacchierotti sing them in private, and I missed his tender expression, particularly in the last pathetic scene, and lamented that their simplicity should be injured, as it was, by an over-flowery style. But his flowery style was absolute simplicity to what we have] heard in latter days. [&hellip;] The first woman, Giuliani, was a very inferior performer, and had an uncertain, thin voice, not always perfectly in tune; yet she was not without merit, had a good figure for the stage, and acted well. The new tenor, Forlivesi, was very indifferent, not near so good as his predecessor.</p>
