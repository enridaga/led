### comment


Langham also instructed Holcroft in mathematics. Thomas Holcroft had a remarkable memory and a great hunger for learning, including literacy, numeracy, singing, violin and was an able, clever stableboy at this time. He studied in earnest John Arnold’s Church Music Reformed, Or The Art of Psalmody Universally Explained Unto All People (1765), so his claim of illiteracy was excessively modest.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">From the little I that day learned, and from another [singing] lesson or two, I obtained a tolerable conception of striking intervals upwards or downwards; such as the third, the fourth, and the remainder of the octave, the chief feature in which I soon understood, but of course I found most difficulty in the third, sixth and seventh. Previously however to any great progress, I was obliged to purchase Arnold&rsquo;s Psalmody; and studious over this divine treasure, I passed many a forenoon extended in the hay-loft. My chief, and almost my only difficulty, lay in the impenetrable obscurity of such technical words as were not explained [&hellip;] I was illiterate, I knew the language of the vulgar well, but little more. Perhaps no words ever puzzled poor mortal more than I was puzzled by the words,&nbsp;<em>major&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>minor keys.&nbsp;</em>[&hellip;] The hours I spent by myself in mastering whatever belonged to notation, and in learning the intervals, occasioned my progress to be so very different from that of the [other singing students], that it excited the admiration of them all; [singing master] Mr Langham, the great man whom I then looked up to, declared it was surprising. If any part was out, I heard it immediately, and often struck the note for them, getting the start of Mr Langham. If he should happen to be absent, he said that I could set them all right; so that by this, and the clearness of my voice, I obtained the nick-name of the sweet singer of Israel.&nbsp;</span></p>

## Memoirs of the late Thomas Holcroft: Written by Himself; and Continued to the Time of His Death.

### volume


1

### comment


The first half of volume 1 was written by Thomas Holcroft, covering only the first sixteen years of his life. William Hazlitt completed the memoir using Holcroft’s diary, notes and other papers, adding commentary. Hazlitt explains in the introduction to volume 1, ‘Mr. Holcroft had intended, for several years before his death, to write an account of his life […] I first became acquainted with Mr. Holcroft about ten years ago; my chief intercourse with him was within the last three or four years of his life’.
