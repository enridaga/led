### comment


The aim of the ‘On Spital Fields’ project was to devise, rehearse and perform a community cantata involving older people, adults and children from Tower Hamlets and a team of professional musicians and animateurs. The twelve pieces comprising the cantata tell the story of Spitalfields, based on fictional texts and historical documents relating to East End London. Makers included composer Jonathan Dove, librettist Alasdair Middleton, Gerry Cornelius conductor and Clare Whistler, director. Pupils from Osmani and St Anne’s primary schools and Mulberry School for Girls formed the children’s choirs (pupils from additional local schools participated in workshops to develop the project). Also performing were the Wessex Singers (Tower Hamlet’s choir for the over 50’s), The Joyful Company of Singers, an SATB choir and a community chorus, students from the Royal Academy of Music and Chroma Ensemble. The Society of Royal Cumberland Youths rang the bells of Christ Church, Spitalfields, its completed restoration celebrated by ‘On Spital Fields’, before both evening performances on 22 and 23 June 2005.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: Cambria, serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">From the initial visits and workshops at the Museum of London, via the historic walks around this magical area, through to the taster and regular rehearsal sessions, we have now come to the point where around 200 people are part of this work. They have helped make it, not just through their singing or playing, but through their own ideas and memories. I remember being at one of the workshops at St Anne&rsquo;s Primary School and hearing the children there suggest a melody for a song about a dove that is now in the final piece note for note. I remember the hoots of laughter as we worked with the Wessex Singers, our older people&rsquo;s group, on singing market cries and calls, and I remember the day all of the Festival staff came together to sing through the final draft and marvel at the sheer beauty of the music.&nbsp;</span></p>
