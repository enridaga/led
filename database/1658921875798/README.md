<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 36.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&ldquo;Musical Imitations, yocal and instrumental: in the Comic Style: performed by G. Wright, Esq.&rdquo; <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>London Cries, in different voices : &ldquo;Four bunches a penny primroses; Ground ivy; Hot cross-buns; Hot spiced gingerbread; Come, buy my sweet violets; and Past twelve o&rsquo;clock and a cloudy morning;&rdquo; accompanied with the violin and organ.―A Laughing Song; in which is introduced an imitation of the sticcato, with a violin accompaniment.―&rdquo;The Highland Laddie,&rdquo; with a favourite Air from the overture to Oscar and Malvina; the Scotch Union Pipes, imitated on the violin.―The singing of a canary bird, accompanied with the violin.―A Song and Chorus: &ldquo;Gladly may we our wealth employ; and may our duty be our joy,&rdquo; with instrumental accompaniments, horns, trumpets, kettle-drums, &amp;c.―The Vauxhall Riot; an original thought. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>The performer is supposed to be in Vauxhall Gardens: by some neglect of the door-keepers, the doors are left open; a number of sheep run into the gardens, which naturally occasions a confusion among the company. Some pickpockets, taking advantage of the confusion, pick the ladies&rsquo; pockets; the ladies cry out &ldquo;Thieves;&rdquo; the thieves, to increase the confusion, cry out &ldquo;Fire;&rdquo; a young woman, having just begun to sing a favourite air, is forced to stop, not being able to be heard on account of the confusion; cries of &ldquo;Fire,&rdquo; &ldquo;Thieves,&rdquo; sheep bleating, and dogs barking, are heard for some time, and the whole ends with an instrumental concert.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
