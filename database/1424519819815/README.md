Ella Fitzgerald: A once in a lifetime opportunity - Ella in the flesh - what a thrill! We'd booked up months ahead and were thoroughly looking forward to seeing her and Oscar Petersen entertain us in front of the Festival Hall packed to overflowing with keen enthusiasts like ourselves. We were, I have to say, not only shocked, but highly embarrassed to find there were fewer than a couple of hundred people scattered out across the entire auditorium. What on earth had happened? Who knows! Fortunately Ella was totally unfazed by this. She had, after all, been used to performing in all sorts of much smaller, more intimate venues, no doubt - cabarets and nightclubs, etc. She invited us all to come down close to the stage, and then proceeded to treat us to a sensationally memorable performance. What a star! Terrific!
