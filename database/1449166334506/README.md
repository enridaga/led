<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">1950s - sitting on those strange seats "suspended" above the river before going to concerts, organ recitals and ballet. 1960s-1970s - visits not so frequent while the children were young. 1980s - monthly visits to hear mainly the LPO. Annual visits to hear Bach's St Matthew Passion - and singing in the choir with the Kent Youth Orchestra on several occasions. 1990s up to now - visits less often (as we moved to Suffolk) and now to the Philharmonia - special memories of the Philharmonia Children's concerts with our grandchildren.&nbsp;</p>
