<p>I enjoyed the Festival of Britain very much when I was student. My husband now [sic] took me out to Dinner and a Concert at the Festival Hall when I first met him in 1953 and many times since! We took my sisters from California to a Concert there on their first visit to London some 30 years ago. I have done First Aid Duties at the Queen Elizabeth Hall for B.R.C.S. many years ago! We have had many happy family visits to Concerts over the years so I have very happy memories. I am looking forward to seeing the New Works finished.</p>
