<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 12.55pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; margin: 0cm 56.0pt .0001pt 0cm;">The great painter [Sir John E. Millais] was devoted to music; in fact to be a musician was to be certain of his sympathy. On more than one occasion he said to me, &ldquo;I love the profession.&rdquo; He happened to be at St. James&rsquo;s Hall the night that Mrs. Hutchinson introduced four songs of mine - settings from Tennyson&rsquo;s &ldquo;In Memoriam&rdquo; at a Monday Pop. She sang them beautifully, with great tenderness and feeling, and she looked so charming into the bargain (&ldquo;ce qui n&rsquo;a jamais g&acirc;t&eacute; rien&rdquo;) that it is no wonder she made a success of them. We had studied them carefully together, and I accompanied her that night. How grateful one feels to the really unselfish singer who enters heart and soul into the spirit of one&rsquo;s composition, and how much one owes them! I am sure I owed the pleasure of knowing Sir John Millais in a great measure to the touching way Mrs. Hutchinson sang &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis better to have loved and lost,&rdquo; for he liked it so much that he asked someone to introduce me to him shortly afterwards.</p>
