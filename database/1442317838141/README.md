### comment


John Evans-Pughe (1925 to 1996) was a chorister (with his younger brother Tom) at the choir of the College of St Nicholas, Chislehurst, under Sir Sydney Nicholson and later a music scholar at Kings School Canterbury, Kent. The St Nicholas choir was recorded for many BBC broadcasts and for Columbia Records. A Columbia recording in 1939 featuring John Evans-Pughe and Michael Lumb as treble soloists singing O Lovely Peace (Handel) and Brother Jamesâ€™ Air (arr. Jacob) was a best seller. 
John did National Service in Egypt and Greece, and then studied science at Trinity College, Dublin. He went on to became an electronics engineer for Marconi Space and Defence Systems, continuing with music in his spare time.

<p>TO: The Rev. J and Mrs. Evans-Pughe,&nbsp; Tovil Vicarage, Maidstone, Kent</p>
<p>FROM: John Evans-Pughe, 14073964 L/Cpl Evans Pughe, S.I.C. c/o A.P.O SALONIKA, B.T.G (or British Forces in Greece)</p>
<p>DATE: August 11 1947</p>
<p>Dear Mummy and Daddy and Tom&hellip;</p>
<p>[this para. translated from French]</p>
<p>&hellip;This morning I took one of the Greek servants to the English Church (one of the domestics works there).&nbsp; A Greek choir sang, and it was the best I&rsquo;ve head during my three years here.</p>
<p>[the following in English]</p>
<p>    </p>
<p>The Greek choir was a mixed one &ndash; male and female, quite small &ndash; almost 20 in all.&nbsp; Their attack and phrasing were marvellous &ndash; no sign of any raggedness.&nbsp; The women didn&rsquo;t spoil it either.&nbsp; They have deeper and much steadier and more solid sounding voices than English women.&nbsp; There were no shrieks and wobbles.&nbsp; They sang in Greek, of course.&nbsp; In the hymns there were to [sic] languages being sung at once&hellip;</p>
