### comment


The Deighn Layrocks (Larks of Dean) was a group of vocal and instrumental musicians and composers from the village of Dean, in Rossendale, many of whom became Baptists in 1747. At various times these musicians formed the nucleus of a separate church (at Lumb) or sang in the choir at other churches. The Larks continued to be active until an organ purchased for the Lumb church in 1858 rendered their services unnecessary (from David W. Music, 'Baptist Church Music', Grove Online).

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The Rev. J.M. Mather of Rawtenstall, in his &ldquo;Rambles round Rossendale,&rdquo;&nbsp;</span>Vol 2, called me an old Deaner, although I was born at Doals, over the hill, and came to reside amongst them at four years of age. When I was about 20 I came in contact with all the members for a good number of years, and I was acquainted with several generations of its singers. On looking over my diary I find that at Water school, on May 19, 1847, a selection of music was given from &ldquo;Judas Maccabeas&rdquo; [<em>sic</em>] and the &ldquo;Te Deum&rdquo;. Also at the Mechanics Institute, Bacup, on Good Friday, 1849, Handel's &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; was performed, and at the house of John Hargreaves at Newchurch, the night before Good Friday, in 1849, a selection was taken from &ldquo;Judas Maccabeas&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Messiah.&rdquo; I also attended a performance at the same house on December 31, 1849. At the Water school, January 5, 1850. Handel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Te Deum&rdquo; was performed. Now at these gatherings no great singers were engaged, they were simply meetings of old musical friends, chiefly those known by the name, &ldquo;Deign Layrocks&rdquo; [&lsquo;Larks of Dean&rsquo;]. These notable singers worshipped at the Baptist Chapel, Lumb, and to see Lumb at its best was to be there on the second Sunday in June, a date well known throughout Rossendale. On this day crowds came from far and near. We first hear of them in 1745, when John Nuttall and his friends began to meet in each others houses to practise music. Shortly afterwards he began to preach. Then they built a chapel at Lumb. But in 1760 they removed to Goodshaw, as this place was more central for the surrounding villages.</p>

### comment


The web resource is a typed copy (made in 1961) of the original black bound note book.  The manuscript volume is dated 'Yours faithfully, Moses Heap. 1904'. It had been copied out by a relative - possibly his daughter Mary - some time after the family had moved to Southport in 1909.  All page numbers in this database pertain to the 1961 typed copy.
