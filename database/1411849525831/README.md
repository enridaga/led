<p>Late Summer 1984 and the RFH played host to Marc Almond's first ever London solo concert and (I think) one of the first "rock" concerts at the venue. It was a brave move. The audience were dressed entirely in regulation goth black and red. The (largely grey haired) ushers were terrified. The show was introduced by transgender entertainer Lana Pillay and the "security staff" kept telling the excited audience to sit down when enthusiasm got the better of them. I remember Marc (in lurid pink sequin dinner jacket) even had to warn people that the show would be stopped early if this continued! It was pure Marc Almond - classy, yet with a hint of anarchy....a perfect night out!</p>
