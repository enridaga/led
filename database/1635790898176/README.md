### comment


The evaluation report describes how ‘a music and dance project was devised to explore a classroom theme of the environment. Two musicians and a choreographer worked with one class and their teacher’, p. 13. The boys and girls from diverse ethnic backgrounds were 9-10 years old. Pupils were involved in making the music/dance piece for public performance at Christ Church (day) and for their school (evening). Project aims included developing listening and composition skills and starting to understand music’s relationship to dance. Glyn Evans led the project.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">A highly successful and enjoyable project with a fabulous team spirit from visiting artists, teachers and pupils alike. The project was well planned and I felt well briefed by [Spitalfields] Festival staff. The final performance piece was meaningful, well thought out, looked and sounded good as was well rooted in the creative processes throughout the project. More importantly the work had a real quality of commitment from the pupils for which they should be congratulated. Particular thanks to [class teacher Veronika Armson&rsquo;s] support and linked artwork.&nbsp;</span></p>

## Spitalfields Festival Evaluation Report: summer 1997 Education and Community Programme 

### comment


The Spitalfields Festival has been, since 1976, a major professional music event in the East End of London. Listening experiences relate to the Festival’s Education and Community Programme (ECP), launched in 1989. It devises education projects with schools and community groups that reflect these groups’ concepts and practices of the arts. The ECP is collaborative, linking musicians, writers and visual artists, and the Spitalfields Festival, with East End of London children, adults and elderly people.
