<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">As a very young member of the Luton Girls Choir you can imagine how thrilled I was to be appearing in a memorable concert on July 7 1951 at the Festival of Britain (Skylon and all) in the Royal Festival Hall. We were performing with Tom Jenkins and his Palm Court Orchestra, BramGay on the trumpet and Reginald Foort at the organ. We sang to an audience of 8,000 and 560 of the local people from Luton came on double decker buses. Two afternoon performances attracted more people than any other afternoon concert. We loved the spacious dressing rooms etc, with places to hang our new festival dresses (blue with a red buckle) and new red shoes - a very far cry from the poky [pokey] arrangements in our usual performance halls. In 1952 there were "Blue Rhapsody" concerts with the Luton Choral Society and the Band of the Irish Guards. Even now coming up to my 70th year, I still feel very much at home in the RFH.</p>
