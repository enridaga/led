<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif; color: black; background: white;">The Governors had been early taught that their Chapel was capable of being converted into a source of pecuniary means for increasing the usefulness of the work they had in hand. What Handel began, other eminent musicians continued, and the Governors having received several blind children into the establishment... they were instructed in music, and became a fruitful source of advantage to the funds of the charity. For upwards of one hundred and thirty years the Chapel has been established, and if the taste of the public for sacred music has increasd and that taste has any beneficial influence on the minds of the people, it has been one of the humble instruments for effecting it.</span></p>
