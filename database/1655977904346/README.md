### comment


Equiano was increasingly concerned for his spiritual well-being at this time in his life. He had been baptised ten years earlier in 1759 at St Margaret’s Church, Westminster Abbey, London. 
Equiano and John Jolly witnessed the eruption of Mt Vesuvius, ‘so near that the ashes from it used to be thick on our deck’. They returned to London in Spring 1770.

<p style="margin: 9pt 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I soon heard of a gentleman who had a ship going to Italy and Turkey, and he wanted a man who could dress hair well [&hellip;] I met with him the next day, and gave him a specimen of my dressing. He liked it so well that he hired me immediately, so that I was perfectly happy; for the ship, master, and voyage, were entirely to my mind. The ship was called the Delawar, and my master's name was John Jolly, a neat smart good humoured man, just such an one as I wished to serve. We sailed from England in July following and our voyage was extremely pleasant.&nbsp;</span></p>

From curiosity, and a wish to be holy, I therefore complied with this ceremony, but its virtues were lost on me, for I found myself nothing the better for it [&hellip;]</span></p>

### comment


Olaudah Equiano was a leading black abolitionist in the late 18th century, his autobiography a vital means of campaigning against the slave trade and promoting his activities as a supporter of justice for other Africans in Britain. He was born 1745 in present-day south-eastern Nigeria. He was captured into the transatlantic slave trade 1755, purchasing his freedom 1766. As an enslaved boy and as a free man, Equiano worked aboard ships in the Caribbean and American colonies becoming an adept seaman and trader. He was a devout Christian. In 1792 he married Susanna Cullen in Cambridgeshire; they had two daughters, Ann Maria and Joanna. Equiano died in London, 1797. His burial place, a cemetery in Tottenham Court Road, was located in 2018.
