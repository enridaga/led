<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I was employed by the DANISH CONSULATE GENERAL FROM 1948-52,and remember that the whole staff of both the embassy and the Consulate General were invited to a concert by the DANISH RADIO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA, during which most of the audience was introduced to Carl Nielsen's Maskerade, and given rave reviews, which we Danes all were delighted to see - I also remember that those bombed out streets, not too far from that wonderful building were a great shock on my first trip out there, and made our respect for those scrappy Londoners larger than ever -- I met and married a Canadian Radar Mechanic, RAF and RCAF during the war - then studying at London Scool of Economics - and when visiting London again as often as possible, after the arrival of three children in Canada, we always tried to take in a concert or other entertainment there, and often friends, who had stayed in England invited us there to our great delight -- Soon I'll be visiting my son, who now lives in London permanently, and he will surely visit that impressive place - with the friends he has!! They are all musical and artistic, even the younger generation ---</p>
