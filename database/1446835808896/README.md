<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">Orlando Gough's Big Sing Thing in the autumn of 2003 was a turning point in my life. This event involved the participation of any willing spectators (hundreds), and workshops led by various choirs singing polyphonic music, one which I knew from having lived in their homeland, the Republic of Georgia.&nbsp; In the way only music can generate, it was an afternoon of coincidences and interweaving turning points for me, which culminated in my meeting one of the most wonderfu women in my life.&nbsp; Also present were members of the London Georgian Choir "Maspindzeli", who were present.&nbsp; As well as the London Bulgarian Ensemble, both of which are open to singing lovers - please feel compelled and get in touch. Best wishes to all musical beings . . . bc</p>
