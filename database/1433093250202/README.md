<p>A ceremonial attended with much eclat was that of the laying of the first stone of the new buildings of the Imperial College of Science and Technology, at South Kensington, by King Edward, who was accompanied by Queen Alexandra. This brilliant function took place in July, 1909. The proposed institution was close to my own University of London, and when my friend Dr. Henry T. Bovey, the Rector of the new College, came and asked me to provide appropriate music to grace and assist the ceremony, I greatly appreciated being selected for this honour. Dr. Bovey was one of the many friends whom I had met in Canada, where at his charming residence he had entertained me with engaging kindness. His attainments had procured his nomination to the important post of Rector of this institution devoted to the most advanced training and research in science, especially in its relation to industry. By permission of the Dean, the full choir of the Abbey was able to attend. I arranged a representative programme of glees, madrigals, and other part-music, which found much acceptance in performance. At the moment when His Majesty tapped and levelled the stone, and declared it to be "well and truly laid," I conducted the choir in a setting of Joseph Addison's magnificent hymn, "The spacious firmament on high," which I had specially composed for the occasion.</p>
