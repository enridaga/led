<p>A painful contrast, in the way of musical entertainments of an ecclesiastical order, to the above performance&nbsp;in the Ges&ugrave;, was afforded by a Midnight Mass I was&nbsp;induced by treacherous persuasion to attend on Christmas&nbsp;Eve at San Luigi dei Francesi...On the 24th December,&nbsp;1869, a peculiarly malignant compatriot had fervently&nbsp;assured me that, at San Luigi dei Francesi, I should&nbsp;hear strains of celestial harmony and contemplate a&nbsp;dazzling illumination in celebration of the Nativity Morn...After much labour&nbsp;and tribulation I at length succeeded in entering the&nbsp;sacred edifice. The first vileness that assailed one of my&nbsp;senses was a mosaic of stenches, amongst which were&nbsp;chiefly distinguishable the malodours of garlic, incense,&nbsp;candle-snuff, boiling grease, damp cloth, and shoe-leather.&nbsp;The next, outraging another sense, was a nondescript&nbsp;noise, respecting which I soon had to ask myself, What may this be, that offends my ears and, in less than a&nbsp;minute, has worn out my patienee ? Is it, haply, the&nbsp;heavenly harmony promised to me? are these the sublime&nbsp;strains that could not by any possibility fail to transport&nbsp;my ravished soul to realms of bliss? It was; they&nbsp;were ! Any score or so of blind-beggars, British-born&nbsp;and musically proclivious, picked up at random in London&nbsp;streets and set to intone a Catnach ballad in, say, sixty&nbsp;verses, could have matched, in every respect, the performance of the San Luigi choristers on that dread&nbsp;Christmas Eve. Moreover, there was an altogether&nbsp;intolerable organ, quivering with senility, and divided&nbsp;against itself &mdash; one of its registers being an eighth of a&nbsp;tone sharper than the other, and both wofuUy out of&nbsp;tune. Upon this instrument of torture some organist in&nbsp;his novitiate had been instructed to do his worst ; and&nbsp;most conscientiously did he fulfil his mission. For&nbsp;instance, whenever the choir had dismally drifted into&nbsp;the tonic chord, he would burst out joyously into that of&nbsp;the two dominants, or wail a plaintive relative minor.&nbsp;None of his dissonant vagaries, however, for a moment&nbsp;disturbed the choristers, or hindered them from plodding&nbsp;doggedly on with gruesome sonority, more nasal than&nbsp;laryngean. The effect was indescribably bewildering &mdash;&nbsp;something like a tale of Hoffmann illustrated by Retzsch&nbsp;and set to music by the fiddler-fiend who once appeared to Tartini in a dream... After suffering a&nbsp;brief and unmerited agony, I struggled forth into the&nbsp;rain with all the haste and eagerness of one pursued by&nbsp;the Avenger. Ever since that fearsome experience I&nbsp;have been accustomed to think of the Christmas Eve&nbsp;choral service performed at San Luigi dei Francesi as the&nbsp;Stomach-ache of Sound.&nbsp;</p>
