<p>As a war child (10 in 1945) the 1st visit to hear music at the Festival Hall was an absolute revelation: the equivalent of black-out curtains being drawn back to reveal a scene of stunning space and brilliance, the music like none I had experienced.&nbsp; Then, 50 years ago in 1957, the London University Graduation Ball was held at RFH: I had a dazzling evening, lasting until dawn, with my husband to be.&nbsp; I still adore the wonderful, concrete South Bank complex.&nbsp; Always will.</p>
