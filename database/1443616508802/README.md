<p>Festival Ballet gave me years of appreciation - Alice in Wonderland, Etudes, Symphony for Fun, The Witch Boy, Variations for Four, accolades being due to Anton Dolin, Alicia Markova, John Gilpin, Fai Lauder and Louis Godfrey. In 1962 my daughter achieved an ambition to dance in the children's section of The Nutcracker, an experience she still recalls with pleasure. Moving to Kent has reduced my concert visits as from 1974, but I arrange annual orchestral trips for our Music Society and long for the re-opening of Festival Hall.&nbsp; PS. What a great concert at QEH on 10/6/06</p>
