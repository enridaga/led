<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I had just told my parents that I had become engaged. There was a sense of shock and disbelief. Nevertheless the family decided to celebrate, and we all came to the Festival Hall (some for the first and only time). The concert was Beethoven's 9th Symphony, Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Klemperer; the first performance, I believe, with the new Philharmonia Chorus. As that magnificent, incomparable sound blazed out in the 4th movement, we felt it as a glorious benediction on our forthcoming marriage. It was the concert of concerts, conducted by that gaunt spiritual giant for whose appearance we would queue all night in the street, to be sure of tickets</p>
