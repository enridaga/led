<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I&nbsp; attended every night of the opening week of the RFH. &nbsp; Denis Matthews was prominent on the programme;&nbsp; his piano concerto music is still the measure for me of any other performances. &nbsp; One evening Toscanini was the conductor. &nbsp; I was a povertystricken teenager and did not attempt to buy a ticket. &nbsp; However, I took my transistor radio and stood happily on the outside steps and listened to the music being played so very nearby. &nbsp; In the interval everyone flowed out, and at the end, I found myself flowing back with them. &nbsp; In those days there was standing room at the sides of the concert hall. &nbsp; Thus it was that I saw Toscanini conduct (for half a concert!).&nbsp; The whole London music scene had gathered there in the audience. &nbsp; One saw all the well-known performers, and their agents (Emmy Tillet in a Box above the podium). Until then the Royal Albert Hall had been the only concert scene. &nbsp; With its majestic echo and curiously intimate atmosphere, it remained a fitting partner to the new Festival Hall, so open, generous and beautifully tuned. &nbsp; The RHS [RFH?]became a real Club House for music lovers.&nbsp; One always found people there whom one knew - both among the performers and the audience. I do hope the new RFH will retain the best of the original one.</p>
