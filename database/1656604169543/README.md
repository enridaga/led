### comment


Holcroft most likely practiced the violin. He notes early in his memoir ‘I must have been around five years old, when [my father] put me under the tuition of a player on the violin, who was a public performer of some repute […] I had an uncommon aptitude for the art I had been put to learn […] I was a prodigy’ (vol. 1, pp. 7-8). Severe poverty befell the family around this time and Holcroft could not pursue a musical career as he had hoped to do.

### comment


The first half of volume 1 was written by Thomas Holcroft, covering only the first sixteen years of his life. William Hazlitt completed the memoir using Holcroft’s diary, notes and other papers, adding commentary. Hazlitt explains in the introduction to volume 1, ‘Mr. Holcroft had intended, for several years before his death, to write an account of his life […] I first became acquainted with Mr. Holcroft about ten years ago; my chief intercourse with him was within the last three or four years of his life’.
