        rdf:value   "<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;\">George Melly: In the immediate post war Festival of Britain the Royal Festival Hall seemed to us very encouraging, and as there was a boom in Revivalist jazz led by Humphrey Lyttelton, it was not long before the Marquis of Donegal arranged for a command perfiormance in front of the very young Princess Elizabeth.&nbsp; We were all very flalttered and my father even came down from Liverpool to come to it.&nbsp; Donegal told me later that my rendition of Frankie and Johnnie \"very much amused the Princess\".&nbsp; Most of the band leaders including Mick Mulligan were introduced to her afterwards, but I, as an anarchist and surrealist was quite relieved not to be.&nbsp; I watched with amusement how they reacted, like most people do when introduced to royalty, as if they had been hit violently in the stomach while bending over and laughing.&nbsp; It was a special day for all that, and although I have appeared quite frequently in one hall or another of the South Bank Centre I don't suppose anything will ever surpass that first visit.&nbsp; I am looking forward to the \"refurbishment\" with mixed feelings.&nbsp; I hope it won't spoil my early adventure there.</p>"^^rdf:HTML;
