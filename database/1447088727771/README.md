<p>In 1951, we managed to get 2 tickets at 2/6 each for one of the opening concerts at the Festival Hall.&nbsp; The seats were on the platform behind the orchestra.&nbsp; The conductor was Sir Adrian Boult, the violin soloist Yfrah Neaman.&nbsp; The orchestra was seated resplendant in tails and everyone was awaiting the arrival of the celebrated conductor.&nbsp; The minutes ticked away, the audience became slightly restive, but no Sir Adrian.&nbsp; Then, with a flourish, about ten minutes later, he burst in upon the scene, dressed - horror of horrors - in a grey pinstripe lounge suit.&nbsp; He mounted the podium, faced the audience, and said "You may wonder why I am dressed as I am.&nbsp; I should like to tell you a story about an American invited to the Lord Mayor's Banquet, who after a delayed Atlantic crossing arrived at Southampton to find his luggage had been lost.&nbsp; He made his way to London, but when he contacted a well known firm of Covent Garden Outfitters, found that all the other guests had been there before him."&nbsp; And with that, he turned around and started conducting.&nbsp; What aplomb!</p>
