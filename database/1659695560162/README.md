<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The contributions of Bramwich and Jones to our hymnology, were published in my weekly <em>Extinguisher</em>, until we collected them in our &ldquo;Shaksperean Chartist Hymn Book.&rdquo;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The following is the most favourite hymn composed by Bramwich.</span><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">―</span><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">We sang it to the hymn tune &ldquo;New Crucifixion.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 36.0pt;">Britannia&rsquo;s sons, though slaves ye be,<br /> God, your Creator, made you free;<br /> He life and thought and being gave,<br /> But never, never made a slave!<br /> <br /> His works are wonderful to see,<br /> All, all proclaim the Deity;<br /> He made the earth, and formed the wave,<br /> But never, never made a slave!<br /> <br /> He made the sky with spangles bright,<br /> The moon to shine by silent night;<br /> The sun―and spread the vast concave,<br /> But never, never made a slave!<br /> <br /> The verdant earth, on which we tread,<br /> Was by His hand all carpeted;<br /> Enough for all He freely gave,<br /> But never, never made a slave!<br /> <br /> All men are equal in His sight,<br /> The bond, the free, the black, the white;<br /> He made them all,―them freedom gave;<br /> God made the man―Man made the slave!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Fourteen hymns were contributed by Bramwich to our &ldquo;Shaksperean Chartist Hymn Book,&rdquo; and sixteen by William Jones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The following was our favourite hymn of those composed by Jones, and we usually sang it to the hymn tune called &ldquo;Calcutta.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 36.0pt;">Sons of poverty assemble,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye whose hearts with woe are riven,<br /> Let the guilty tyrants tremble,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who your hearts such pain have given.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will never<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the shrine of truth be driven.<br /> <br /> Must ye faint―ah! How much longer?<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Better by the sword to die<br /> Than to die of want and hunger:<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They heed not your feeble cry:<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lift your voices―<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lift your voices to the sky!<br /> <br /> Rouse them from their silken slumbers,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trouble them amidst their pride:<br /> Swell your ranks, augment your numbers,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spread the Charter, far and wide!<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Truth is with us:<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God Himself is on our side.<br /> <br /> See the brave, ye spirit broken,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That uphold your righteous cause;<br /> Who against them hath not spoken?<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are, just as Jesus was,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Persecuted<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By bad men and wicked laws.<br /> <br /> Dire oppression, Heaven decrees it,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From our land shall soon be hurled:<br /> Mark the coming time and seize it―<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every banner be unfurled!<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spread the Charter!<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spread the Charter through the world.<br /> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I venture to add one of the only two hymns that I contributed to our Hymn Book: we sang it in the noble air of the &ldquo;Old Hundredth.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 36.0pt;">God of the earth, and sea, and sky,<br /> To Thee Thy mournful children cry:<br /> Didst Thou the blue that bends o&rsquo;er all<br /> Spread for a general funeral pall?<br /> <br /> Sadness and gloom pervade the land;<br /> Death―famine―glare on either hand;<br /> Didst Thou plant earth upon the wave<br /> Only to form one general grave?<br /> <br /> Father, why didst Thou form the flowers?<br /> They blossom not for us, or ours:<br /> Why didst Thou clothe the fields with corn?<br /> Robbers from us our share have torn.<br /> <br /> The ancients of our wretched race<br /> Told of Thy sovereign power and grace,<br /> That in the sea their foes o&rsquo;erthrew―<br /> Great Father!―is the record true?<br /> <br /> Art Thou the same who, from all time,<br /> O&rsquo;er every sea, through every clime,<br /> The stained oppressor&rsquo;s guilty head<br /> Hast visited with vengeance dread?<br /> <br /> To us,―the wretched and the poor,<br /> Whom rich men drive from door to door,―<br /> To us, then, make Thy goodness known,<br /> And we Thy lofty name will own.<br /> <br /> Father, our frames are sinking fast:<br /> Hast Thou our names behind Thee cast?<br /> Our sinless babes with hunger die:<br /> Our hearts are hardening!―Hear our cry!<br /> <br /> Appear, as in the ancient days!<br /> Deliver us from our foes, and praise<br /> Shall from our hearts to Thee ascend―<br /> To God our Father, and our Friend!</p>
