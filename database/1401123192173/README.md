### has_evidence_text


Among many thousands of young people, our school in Dundee organized an excursion to the Festival of Britain in 1951. Our hotel was in Southend - so great was the demand for places to stay. How exciting all the exhibtions all over the South Bank site were. Of course the Festival Hall was among the places visited then. My first experience of a concert in the Hall was on 11th April 1958, when I attended a concert given by the great Yugoslav soprano Sena Jurianc. Of course, she enthralled the audience, filling the hall with her glorious voice. If my memory is correct H.R.H.Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone was in the Royal Box. I still have the programme as a memory of my first concert in the Festival Hall.
