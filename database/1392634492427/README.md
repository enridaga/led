On Saturday, St John's Eve, the following ceremony took place in the morning: A chapel had been prepared on the field, opposite the stage from which the jousts were viewed. It was very large, with a lofty tribune, on which was the altar, most sumptuously furnished with ten very large silver-gilt images of saints and two large golden candlesticks, all exquisitely wrought; also a large jewelled crucifix entirely of gold, and a large golden bason and two golden vases, the one for the wine and the other for the water. On this spot Cardinal Wolsey sang high mass, with the following ceremonies:
	...The choristers of the two chapels of France and England sang this mass; the music by Perino, accompanied by an organ, with trombones and cornets.
