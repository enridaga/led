<p class="MsoNormal">Mr. Gilmore was a modest and a wise man, and conducted but little of the music himself; but that little was great,&mdash;for did he not direct the &ldquo;Anvil Chorus &rdquo; ? Will Boston, or at least its Jubilee participators, ever forget the sensation it had when the one hundred firemen&mdash;each in his belt, helmet, and red flannel shirt, carrying a long-handled blacksmith&rsquo;s hammer at &ldquo; right shoulder shift &rdquo; like a musket&mdash;marched into the hall and on to the stage in two files of fifty, and then separated far enough to form a red frame for two sides of the orchestra, which meanwhile was playing the introduction to the &ldquo;Anvil Chorus &rdquo; ? Reaching their special, real anvils, the firemen faced the audience, lifted their hammers to the proper position, and at the right musical moment played and sang the melody.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If ever &ldquo;the welkin rang&rdquo; it did then !</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In addition to the sounds from a hundred anvils there was the great organ, military band, drum corps, all the bells in the city achime, and a cannon accompaniment. This last came from two batteries of well served guns stationed at a short distance from the building, and a gun was fired off by electricity on the first beat of each measure. A small table was placed on the stage, close to the director, with a set of electric buttons, each having a wire leading to a gun. Mr. John Mullaly was the artist who pressed the button; the gun did the rest. These guns were similarly used for all national airs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At the termination of the &ldquo;Anvil Chorus &rdquo; there was enormous applause. The whole mass of people rose to their feet, jumped up and down, and nearly dislocated their arms by waving handkerchiefs, fans, hats, parasols, even babies. I am sure that I was never in any great assembly where such wild, almost frantic cheering and applause was heard. Fifty thousand people in a wooden building can make some noise.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The dear, wonderful old maestro, Verdi, did certainly furnish a great opportunity for P. S. Gilmore. It is equally certain that Verdi never dreamed of the possibilities contained in the &ldquo; of time began to pound the anvils,&mdash;right, left, right, left,&mdash; while the great orchestra and chorus slam-bang &rdquo; popular melody. When the piece was ended, the gentlemen firemen would march out; and, the applause continuing, they would march back again and go through the whole exciting performance once more.</p>
