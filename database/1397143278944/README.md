### has_evidence_text


This morning was glorious - sunny and clear. Church bells sounded joyful and a train-load of Tommies passed us on their way to Blighty - everything seemed happy. The church parade came our way and we followed them to the garrison church, which is the cinema at other times. The church was packed - there must have been nearly 1,000 men. The music was a good brass band, the padre was a fine fellow, and everything went with a swing, as services up the line usually do. One thing impressed me, although I think it happened more by accident than intention. In the responses before the Venite, the music and congregation could not get together in ‘As it was in the beginning is now’, etc, and only a few sang it - but when it came to the last one, ‘The Lord’s name be praised’, the clarinets and all the band were full blast and the men sang it at the tops of their voices. It fitted the day and the sunshine and the war being over well.
They wanted us to sit in front with the officers but we couldn’t face it and went to the gallery, as we were the only two women there. The result was that many of the men were screwing their heads round to have a look at us. After the service the troops all assembled in the square in front of the cathedral and marched off, headed by a fine band.
