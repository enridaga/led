### has_evidence_text


"In March 1982, shortly after joining the Philharmonia, I took part in a performance of William Walton's Belshazzar's Feast with the Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Andre Previn. The concert was in celebration of the composer's 80th birthday and he was present in the audience - sitting in the royal box. At the end he stood, in tears, with the rest of the audience for a standing ovation.
My sister worked as a voluntary steward at the Festival Hall and during the concert - which was transmitted live on radio and televsion - she repeatedly asked a tv camera man to focus on me, sitting in the back row of the chorus. I was, of course, blissfully unaware of this as I was concentrating on the tricky rythms of this thrilling piece and counting like mad. But when I spoke to friends who had watched the tv transmission they all assumed that there was something going on between the camera man and me, as I was featured so often in the close-ups!"
