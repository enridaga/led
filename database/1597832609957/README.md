The aim of the ‘On Spital Fields’ project was to devise, rehearse and perform a community cantata involving older people, adults and children from Tower Hamlets and a team of professional musicians and animateurs. The twelve pieces comprising the cantata tell the story of Spitalfields, based on fictional texts and historical documents relating to East End London. Makers included composer Jonathan Dove, librettist Alasdair Middleton, Gerry Cornelius conductor and Clare Whistler, director. Pupils from Osmani and St Anne’s primary schools and Mulberry School for Girls formed the children’s choirs (pupils from additional local schools participated in workshops to develop the project). Also performing were the Wessex Singers (Tower Hamlet’s choir for the over 50’s), The Joyful Company of Singers, an SATB choir and a community chorus, students from the Royal Academy of Music and Chroma Ensemble. The Society of Royal Cumberland Youths rang the bells of Christ Church, Spitalfields, its completed restoration celebrated by ‘On Spital Fields’, before both evening performances on 22 and 23 June 2005. 

Dove’s score is dedicated to Christopher Robert Vaughan (1961-1999), a passionate supporter of Spitalfields Festival. Vaughan left a legacy that helped to fund ‘On Spital Fields’. The community cantata was intended to celebrate Vaughan’s life.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: Cambria, serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">[Email dated 29 June 2005]</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Almost a week has passed since I saw&nbsp;<em>On Spital Fields</em>&nbsp;at Christ Church&mdash;and I am still under its influence. It was such a moving experience that I do not really know where to begin.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">[&hellip;]</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The concept of collaboration in and with the community was just brilliant.&nbsp;I was lucky enough to sit close to a man who had gone to one (or more?) schools to quiz children on their musical perception of stories/emotions; his account&mdash;at any rate what little I was able to hear of it&mdash;was fascinating.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Jonathan Dove did a fantastic job putting it all together in such a way that you continually listened to wonderfully flowing music. The beautiful end of the long and many times sad story to the sound of song birds ensured that we all, audience and performers alike, left with broad and happy smiles on our faces.&nbsp;The performers, young and old, moved in and out like the most amazing clockwork. And visually, the figures in black with brown arms moving, weaving and waving, conveying joy and sadness was just unbelievable. It was superb choreography.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">I am sorry if this all sounds a bit over the top. But this is how I felt and feel about it.&nbsp;Maybe it could be re-shaped/adapted by and for other communities? Having seen the concentration on the faces of the kids and of the teenage girls (I sat near the door and saw then at close quarters as they came and left afterwards&mdash;it was most impressive): their involvement in a venture of this kind must have had an enormous effect on their lives and studies as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: Cambria, serif;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Congratulations to you and all who made it possible&mdash;and PLEASE TAKE IT FURTHER.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: Cambria, serif;">&nbsp;</p>

### comment


The aim of the ‘On Spital Fields’ project was to devise, rehearse and perform a community cantata involving older people, adults and children from Tower Hamlets and a team of professional musicians and animateurs. The twelve pieces comprising the cantata tell the story of Spitalfields, based on fictional texts and historical documents relating to East End London. Makers included composer Jonathan Dove, librettist Alasdair Middleton, Gerry Cornelius conductor and Clare Whistler, director. Pupils from Osmani and St Anne’s primary schools and Mulberry School for Girls formed the children’s choirs (pupils from additional local schools participated in workshops to develop the project). Also performing were the Wessex Singers (Tower Hamlet’s choir for the over 50’s), The Joyful Company of Singers, an SATB choir and a community chorus, students from the Royal Academy of Music and Chroma Ensemble. The Society of Royal Cumberland Youths rang the bells of Christ Church, Spitalfields, its completed restoration celebrated by ‘On Spital Fields’, before both evening performances on 22 and 23 June 2005. 

Dove’s score is dedicated to Christopher Robert Vaughan (1961-1999), a passionate supporter of Spitalfields Festival. Vaughan left a legacy that helped to fund ‘On Spital Fields’. The community cantata was intended to celebrate Vaughan’s life.
