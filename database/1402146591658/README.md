### has_evidence_text


Towards the end of the war, when the doodle bugs were dropping on London we actually got some evacuee ‘cockney’ kids into our northern school. They talked in a very funny way, and we could scarcely understand a word they said. When we were convinced that they were not actually Germans in disguise we became quite friendly towards them but they always seemed foreign.
The radio was all-important especially ‘Children’s Hour’ and ‘Toy-town’ and Uncle Mac, but we also listened to the News which always seemed to begin with something like: ‘Here is the News and this is Alvar Liddell reading it: yesterday one hundred allied bombers raided Germany, three are missing……..’ And there was Workers’ Playtime with Bill Gates and Music Hall and funny comedians like Vic Oliver and Rob Wilton whose jokes always seemed to involve ‘the foreman’ or ‘the sergeant’. And there were of course all those lovely sentimental wartime songs about bluebirds being over the white cliffs of Dover. Sometimes we had a good laugh listening to Lord Haw Haw.

### comment


The BBC's WW2 People's War project ran from June 2003 to January 2006. The aim of the project was to collect the memories of people who had lived and fought during World War Two on a website; these would form the basis of a digital archive which would provide a learning resource for future generations. 
The target audience, people who could remember the war, was at least 60 years old. Anyone who had served in the armed forces during the war was, at the start of the project, at least 75. Most of them had no experience of the internet. Yet over the course of the project, over 47,000 stories and 14,000 images were gathered. A national story gathering campaign was launched, where 'associate centres' such as libraries, museums and learning centres, ran events to helped gather stories. Many hundereds of volunteers, many attached to local BBC radio stations, assisted in this. Read more about how the stories were gathered. 
The resulting archive houses all of these memories. These stories don't give a precise overview of the war, or an accurate list of dates and events; they are a record of how a generation remembered the war, 60 years of more after the events, and remain in the Archive as they were contributed. The Archive is not a historical record of events, a collection of government or BBC information, recordings or documents relating to the war..
