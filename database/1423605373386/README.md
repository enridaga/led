## excerpt from 'Southbank Centre Archive' (219 words)

### value


<p>My memories of RFH span the 60s, 70s and 2000s, from concerts attended with Ilford County High School to a memorable visit in 1971 and a return with my own children in 2002....The strangest experience was on a study trip from the Architecture Dept of Bristol University in 1969/70 to examine the acoustics. Having been taken round the various acoustic chambers and learning how manufactured the reverberation really was, we ended up in the auditorium when Karen Carpenter, her brother and the band were doing a sound check and rehearsal. I had long been fascinated by Karen Car[enter's voice and was amazed to be sitting in on a rehearsal of 'Goodbye To Love' with its phenomenal guitar solo. (I had lost my one and only true love two years previously, and this had now become my anthem). Suddenly we were descended upon by Carpenters' 'boys' and ejected before the end of the final guitar solo. I was mortified, but had to pretend to my Uni mates that I really wasn't bothered. I haven't been able to listen to that song since without complaining that the DJ has cut short the final guitar solo. Yes, I suppose I 'heart' the RFH, and I was surprised again last week when I saw what a fantastic job is being done with its remodelling.</p>
