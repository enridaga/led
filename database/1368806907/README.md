### has_evidence_text


 sssNow one night, it was a mixed neighborhood as I say, on Lake and Polina Street on the West Side of Chicago. And there were eight colored men, blind colored men.... Two or three basses and banjos and a guitar, mandolin and guitar. And they were singing spirituals. Gospel music. And my brother and I were, let me preface this by saying this. We were tough little monkeys in those days. Rough kids, you know, that's a tough neighborhood. And we would steal everything we could lay our hands on. We were bad.... So we could hear this music and go over to see these eight guys...playing this music which was really something. They were playing spirituals and it's swinging. It's rocking, it's going. And my God, my brother and I just flipped man.... And my brother and I started passing the hat for them and the people started putting the money in the hat for them...and we gave them every penny.... They must have been good because we loved them and we didn't even steal one penny from them.

### has_evidence_text


 sssNow one night, it was a mixed neighborhood as I say, on Lake and Polina Street on the West Side of Chicago. And there were eight colored men, blind colored men.... Two or three basses and banjos and a guitar, mandolin and guitar. And they were singing spirituals. Gospel music. And my brother and I were, let me preface this by saying this. We were tough little monkeys in those days. Rough kids, you know, that's a tough neighborhood. And we would steal everything we could lay our hands on. We were bad.... So we could hear this music and go over to see these eight guys...playing this music which was really something. They were playing spirituals and it's swinging. It's rocking, it's going. And my God, my brother and I just flipped man.... And my brother and I started passing the hat for them and the people started putting the money in the hat for them...and we gave them every penny.... They must have been good because we loved them and we didn't even steal one penny from them.

### has_evidence_text


 sssNow one night, it was a mixed neighborhood as I say, on Lake and Polina Street on the West Side of Chicago. And there were eight colored men, blind colored men.... Two or three basses and banjos and a guitar, mandolin and guitar. And they were singing spirituals. Gospel music. And my brother and I were, let me preface this by saying this. We were tough little monkeys in those days. Rough kids, you know, that's a tough neighborhood. And we would steal everything we could lay our hands on. We were bad.... So we could hear this music and go over to see these eight guys...playing this music which was really something. They were playing spirituals and it's swinging. It's rocking, it's going. And my God, my brother and I just flipped man.... And my brother and I started passing the hat for them and the people started putting the money in the hat for them...and we gave them every penny.... They must have been good because we loved them and we didn't even steal one penny from them.

### has_evidence_text


 sssNow one night, it was a mixed neighborhood as I say, on Lake and Polina Street on the West Side of Chicago. And there were eight colored men, blind colored men.... Two or three basses and banjos and a guitar, mandolin and guitar. And they were singing spirituals. Gospel music. And my brother and I were, let me preface this by saying this. We were tough little monkeys in those days. Rough kids, you know, that's a tough neighborhood. And we would steal everything we could lay our hands on. We were bad.... So we could hear this music and go over to see these eight guys...playing this music which was really something. They were playing spirituals and it's swinging. It's rocking, it's going. And my God, my brother and I just flipped man.... And my brother and I started passing the hat for them and the people started putting the money in the hat for them...and we gave them every penny.... They must have been good because we loved them and we didn't even steal one penny from them.
