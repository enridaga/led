<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I used to travel by train to the school sports ground regularly in the 1940s and 1950s using Hungerford Bridge between Charing Cross and Waterloo East. Much excitement was generated by the construction work of the Festival of Britain in 1951 with the futuristic Skylon, The Dome of Discovery and the Festival Hall itself built close to where a large chimney was dimolished. Eventually through enlightened school involvement visits were organised to concerts for a cost of 3/6p, if my memory is correct, sitting somewhere right at the back. The modern design, open spaces and comfortable seats were eye openers. I remember hearing great performers like Artur Rubinstein, Claudio Arrau and have never forgotten the experience.&nbsp;</p>
