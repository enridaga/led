<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: Cambria, serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">[&hellip;] Other members [of staff at Osmani Primary School] also sat in on some of the workshops after I explained how good they were from a teaching point of view&hellip; The way Suzi [Zumpe, vocal animateur] worked with the children to get them to sing and perform at that level was fantastic. Their belief in themselves as performers, singing alongside so many others and being treated the same made them feel they were just as good and as important as the professional performers.&nbsp;</span></p>
