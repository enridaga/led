<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">In 1951 I was a seven year old in St Thomas's Hospital for a month.&nbsp; My parents visited me and told me about the Festival Hall and how it was growing.&nbsp; I saw it when I was discharged and on 'out patients' visits.&nbsp; I later came up with my junior school to the Saturday morning children's concerts.&nbsp; We came by coach and it was a great introduction to the Festival Hall.S</p>
