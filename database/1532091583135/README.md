<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The first time I tasted olives was many years ago and my introduction was a complete failure. I found the one I had in my mouth impossible to swallow and when no-one was looking slipped it into the handkerchief I was wearing in my breast pocket and forgot about it. I must explain that I was there with three other members of our [male voice] quartet and we had been engaged professionally, an invitation to dinner thrown in. When the time to perform arrived we all trooped on to the platform and sang a serious quartet, and as an encore chose a humorous one where at one part we had to pull a handkerchief smartly from our breast pockets and pretend to weep. You can guess what happened. The olive I had concealed in my handkerchief went sailing across the room and after hitting a lady on the nose, fell into a wine glass.&nbsp;</span></p>
