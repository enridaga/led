<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">[Harry West details his love of organ music and learning to play, largely self-taught, in pages 28; 32 &ndash; 35 of his memoir. The related listening experiences are included in the Listening Experience Database as separate events. He notes early in the memoir of his family&rsquo;s &lsquo;many removals&rsquo; around and in Bristol, and that his mother, Sarah Jane West (nee King), had a mania for moving house].&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Attention should be given to a subject which has occupied much of my leisure time and interest, namely, Music. The first large chapel I was in at about six years of age was &ldquo;Old Market Methodist&rdquo; [Bristol]. We sat in the gallery, and I remember being fascinated with the large organ with gilded pipes, and the anthem singing of the effective and large choir before it. I nearly worshipped the organist who seemed to wield and control so much power.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Some years later my father took me to Colston Hall, the original hall, which seated more than the present one [1950s] and the organ looked more imposing with the enormous pipes standing out in a great semi-circular case on the stage. The organist was Mr. George Riseley, who was also organist of the Cathedral. There was a huge congregation which gathered every Sunday afternoon&mdash;about three thousand. As an opening voluntary Mr. Riseley played &ldquo;Handel&rsquo;s Largo&rdquo;, although I did not know the title then; I was entranced.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Later we attended Bushey Park Methodist Chapel in Totterdown. I was also taken with the organ and choir there, but the organ standing on the ground floor did not seem so imposing; it stood at the side. Then, owing to one of our many removals, we attended Ebenezer Methodist Church in British Road, Bedminster [Bristol].&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The organ, a large three manual one was placed in the gallery, behind the pulpit, with the choir before it. I was, as usual, taken with the music and longed to be able to get instruction in organ playing. I could at that time, play hymn tunes on our small harmonium, but could not afford lessons, and I would not incur my parents in the expense as I know that they had an economic struggle.&nbsp;</span></p>
