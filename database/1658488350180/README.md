### comment


Although Sandersonâ€™s account of music-making and listening given here is not a unique experience, it is obviously based on first-hand observation of local peasant customs.  His name has therefore been included as a listener.

<p class="MsoNormal">Church music generally composes a part of the education of a Cumbrian peasant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They are instructed in it by the parish clerk, or by some itinerant professor; and in the course of a few months, by the means of a good ear, and a tuneable voice, acquire as much skill in it, as to be able to gratify the taste of a country audience, at least as far as an accurate combination of sound extends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>As to the principle of the science, they and their instructors are equally ignorant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When the school breaks up, they who compose the choir, and he who leads it, have generally a <em>ball</em> at the village ale-house, in order to experience joys of a more <em>terrestrial</em> nature than those which spring from <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">psalm-singing</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Fiddling, dancing, and drinking continue to a late hour: the divine strains, which they lately sung, are forgotten; and the heart shut against all the devout feelings which they are calculated to inspire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>A practice so offensive to every pious and religious mind, cannot certainly be too soon abolished.</p>
