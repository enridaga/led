<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">After the carnival, the <em>Opera Seria</em> was got up with great splendour. The Emperour was daily expected, and his approach was announced by the arrival of troops of Venetian dancers and singers, and a swarm of parasites and adventurers, <em>mendici min&aelig; balatrones, hoc genus</em> <em>omne,</em> who generally form a part of the train of royalty. The arrival of such artists as <em>Pisaroni, Pinotti</em>, and <em>Tachinardi,</em> however, produced a much greater sensation at Trieste, than the long expected visit of its sovereign. Two factions arose about the merits of two eminent <em>ballerine, Torelli</em> and <em>Cortese,</em> and the controversy was agitated with all the heat of party animosity. The theatre resembled the scene of a popular election, each party endeavouring to drown the plaudits of the other by hisses and exclamations, and hailing its favourite with shouts of triumphant applause, until the governor had to interpose his authority, to restore decorum.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">The opera house is a large edifice, with a handsome front, forming one side of a considerable square. It is situated on the margin of the sea, near the </span><em style="font-family: Arial;">Molo di St. Carlo.</em><span style="font-family: Arial;"> The sounds of the orchestra and the stage, often pass through its windows, lulling the waves into attention, and coming upon the senses of the sea-worn mariner, like those scented gales, that blow from the coast of " Araby the blest." The Greek sailor seated on the deck of his vessel, often hears a low concert of instrumental sounds, and voices borne though the air, which might recall to his mind the miracles of that ancient musick, which expired when the soul of his country was conquered.</span></p>
