### has_evidence_text


The hymns were a very inspiring and moving part of the programme, and worthy of the occasion. The rest of the service adhered to the usual afternoon
form, the anthem (selected by the committee) being a short composition of mine to words by Shakespeare (Richard III., Act 5, Sc. 3) :-

Remember this
God, and our good cause, fight upon our side ;
The prayers of Holy Saints, and wronged souls,
Like high rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces.

As these words are put into the mouth of a Welshman (Richmond, afterwards Henry VII.) they proved very appropriate.

Her Majesty Queen Alexandra and H.R.H. Princess Victoria, who were present, graciously congratulated me on the music, as well as my little Motet, as they left the Abbey. 

A unique feature of the event was the attendance of two Premiers of the British Empire Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. H. M. Hughes who collected alms during
the proceedings.

The Prime Minister also was kind enough to write me the following letter :

10, Downing Street,
Whitehall,
June 27th, 1918.

DEAR SIR FREDERICK, While the memory of the historic Welsh service in Westminster Abbey in aid of the Welsh Prisoners of War Fund is still fresh in my mind, I wish to thank you for your great and valued help in making this unique occasion such a complete success. It was a triumph of organization and
co-operation, and I should like to say how greatly interested I was in the musical side of the programme, which under your skilled direction made such a
memorable feature. Your setting of Bishop Boyd Carpenter's hymn was beautiful. The choir under your leadership did extremely well. As Patron of the
Fund, I feel it my duty to send you this word of formal and grateful acknowledgment.
Yours very faithfully,
D. LLOYD GEORGE.
