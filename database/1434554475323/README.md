<p>One of the things that struck me most at the Royal Gardens was the smile of Baby Dodds. When he played drums he had the most patched-up material for a drum set that I'd ever seen in my life, but he had a rhythm entirely his own, and I feel that as a drummer he has more personality than any other specialist on any other instrument. He was a man of natural playfulness, possessed by rhythm. Just to see him smile and to hear his beat would make you happy.</p>
<p>As for Johnny Dodds, his brother, I sincerely believe that he was the greatest clarinetist that ever lived and I've never heard any clarinetist play like he did in the lower register of his instrument.</p>
<p>There was no other orchestra during that time the could play like Joe Oliver and his Creole Jazz Band.</p>
