<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Some of Don Matteo's melodies approached very nearly to the style of the last-mentioned composer [P&auml;esiello]; they exhibited the same unlaboured, natural expression, the same beautiful simplicity which we admire in P&auml;esiello's works. I was not sparing in my praise, sincere as it came; and the delighted author, encouraged by our approbation, proceeded <em>con</em> <em>amore</em> in the rehearsal, till he came to the <em>finale</em> of the first act. "This," said he, "is the pride of the whole: but you will hear it to great disadvantage, Signor Don Luigi; it requires six voices in the full parts, and including yourself, we can muster but three."&mdash;" I take the fourth," exclaimed Don Michele.&mdash;"<em>Et moi, je me fais fort du reste</em>," added Mons. B. who had for this half hour, by a humming accompaniment, striven to impress us with an idea of his knowledge of music [&hellip;] Overjoyed with the discovery of such a combination of talents, Don Matteo assigned the parts, and began. At first the performance proceeded very respectably; but when Don Michele and Monsieur B's turns came to join the ranks, the <em>Sestetto</em> was completely at "sixes and sevens." Not exactly that the <em>spiritual</em> performer was <em>wanting</em> in time; on the contrary, he gave it too liberally: the slow progress of the andante probably proved too tedious to his national vivacity; he went on <em>au pas de charge</em>, yet withal finding sufficient room to interlard his falsetto strains with innumerable decorative graces and flourishes <em>dans le bon genre</em>.---Don Michele, likewise, had a time of his own; so there was abundance of time between them of one sort or other. For the tortured features of Don Matteo's countenance during this severe trial, [see] Hogarth's "Enraged Musician."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Hitherto,&nbsp;</span>however, his good breeding had prevented any severe token of his just displeasure: but when Monsieur B., ere <em>we</em> had come to the bottom of the left page, had already run his race through the right, and, with a <em>volti subito</em>, turned the leaf, Don Matteo's cup of patience overflowed at once; he jumped from his chair, and ran, like a madman, up and down the room.</p>
