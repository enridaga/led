<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I took my son, who was only 5 at the time, to attend the Sparks concert in October 2002 and he thoroughly enjoyed the experience from his front row seat, despite my concerns about the loudness of the music. It was also my first, but not last, visit to the Festival Hall and the whole experience was amazing.&nbsp;</p>
