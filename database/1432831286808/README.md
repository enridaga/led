In December, 1889, came the funeral of Robert Browning, a great and impressive service, attended by many distinguished people. I was asked to set
some words of Mrs. Browning's, to be sung at the graveside, the verse suggested being, "What would we give to our beloved." Referring to the choice of these words, Mrs. Oliphant wrote from Windsor: "I think it a most beautiful thought, and one which Browning would have entirely appreciated, to lay him
in his grave to the sound of his wife's beautiful words." Afterwards some very kind letters were written to me by members of the Browning family.
