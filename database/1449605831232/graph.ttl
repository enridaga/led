Our conductor was Mr. Geo. J. Webb,&mdash;an excellent general musician, but who had never heard the overture.

Rapping on the desk, he gave the signal to begin; out piped two flutes,&mdash;nothing else. He rapped again, implying that the players had not been ready to begin; then he said, &ldquo;We will try again.&rdquo; He gave the signal&mdash;and out piped the two flutes. That caused a little titter of surprise, and we all looked quizzically at each other. Mr. Webb, however, dutifully gave the signal for the next &ldquo; hold &rdquo; or chord, when two clarinets joined the two flutes! More surprise. At the third hold (chord) the fagotti and horns were added, and at the fourth hold (chord) the entire wood and wind instruments, all sounding most distressingly out of tune.

At the end of the violin passage, the wood and wind again held a very dissonant chord for two measures, which this time sounded so abominably out of tune that it really was as bad as if each man played any note he pleased ; and it was so irresistibly funny that again everybody burst out laughing.
