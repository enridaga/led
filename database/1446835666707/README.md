### value


<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">Jerry Lee Lewis - stiff backed, pale faced, hollow cheeked - his hands thundering out the opening chords of Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On. The audience, the auditorium meant nothing. This was Anytown, Anywhere. This was his train passing through.&nbsp;</p>
