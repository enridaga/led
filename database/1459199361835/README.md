### comment


David Attenborough produced Song Hunter, a series of programmes about folk music, for BBC TV in 1953.  In this account he describes hearing the music live, as he was in the studio, but the song would, of course, have been heard by a wider audience as it was broadcast.  Alan Lomax presented the series.
