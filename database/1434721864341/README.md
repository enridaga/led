McPartland and others, including his brother, as young boys, were known first as the Austin High School Gang, before forming their band, the Blue Friars.

<p>What we used to do was put the record on--one of the [New Orleans] Rhythm Kings', naturally--play a few bars, and then all get our notes. We'd have to tune our instruments up to the record machine, to the pitch, and go ahead with a few notes. Then stop! A few more bars of the record, each guy would pick out his notes and boom! we would go on and play it. Two bars, or four bars or eight--we would get in on each phrase then all play it.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>It was a funny way to learn but in three or four weeks we could finally play one tune all the way through-- "Farewell Blues". Boy, that was our tune.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Most of us had a musical training [violin].</p>
<p>Bud Freeman was the only guy that had&nbsp;<em>not</em> had any training[.]</p>
<p>[...]&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was one thing I could recognise in Bud then--he had a terrific beat. He still has. He began by just playing rhythm, getting on one note and holding it; I mean swinging on it, just that one note. He didn't change the harmony or anything[.]</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>We were too young to get into the Friar's Inn [downtown Chicago], so the only way we could hear the Rhythm Kings was to go down and stand in the doorway and listen. It was great when someone opened the door and we could hear it louder.</p>
