We had a merry facetious fellow on board called Dickson.  He sung pretty well.  He squinted and the natives mimicked him.  Abenoue, King of Atooi, could cock his eye like Dickson better than any of his subjects.  Abenoue called him Billicany, from his often singing ‘Rule Britannia’.  Abenoue learned the air and the words as near as he could pronounce them.  It was an amusing thing to hear the King and Dickson sing. Abenoue loved him better than any man in the ship, and always embraced him every time they met on shore or in the ship, and began to sing, ‘Tule Billicany, Billicany Tule,’ etc....
