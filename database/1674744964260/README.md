### comment


The listening experience is found in a letter from Elizabeth Carter to her life-long dearest friend Catherine Talbot dated 20 January 1748. Original spelling, punctuation and capitalisation retained.
Elizabeth Carter was a member of the Bluestockings Society, educated women who met and exchanged letters about a wide variety of intellectual interests. The origin of the term may reference a gentleman who participated in the group wearing blue stockings, not the formal black stockings that convention required. He was welcomed none the less, suggesting a spirit of intellectual enquiry and companionship that changed by the Victorian era when ‘Bluestocking’ became a derogatory term directed at women interested in intellectual pursuits.

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 7.5pt; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; vertical-align: baseline;">This place is at present a perfect scene of gaiety. There is a set of officers from Flanders, extremely well-bred agreeable men, who are very fond of&nbsp;music and dancing,&nbsp;and this gives great life to all our public diversions. On twelfth night we had an assembly of about ninety people, and there was fine crowding to make one's way through them, as the room is much too small for such a place as this. The first part of the evening, as it was properly a card assembly, every body played cards, but in the midst of this profundity of whist, folks who love music, were agreeably surprized by the sudden&nbsp;striking up of several instruments,&nbsp;which were introduced to entertain the company,&nbsp;by the officers.&nbsp;This was a matter of great offence, and violently shocked some of the elder ladies, who thought it was monstrous to be so interrupted in their game, and that such a horrid noise was a downright infringement of the rights of the assembly, so the musicians were ordered to depart in the midst of their tune. Adieu! I am going to drink a quart of milk and tea with Don Quixote, and then I shall be at your service again.</p>
