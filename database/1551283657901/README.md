### comment


Henry Croswell (1840–93) kept a record of his visits to churches in London over a period of more than twelve years (1872–85).  He made methodical notes about the number of clergy, the churchmanship, the congregation, the sermon and the church architecture, as well as commenting on the music that he heard (the organ, the hymns and the choir).  The above listening experience has been extracted from one of these records.
The S.P.C.K. (Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge) hymnbook refers to ‘Church Hymns’ (1871) and/or ‘Church Hymns with Tunes (1874, under the musical editorship of Arthur Sullivan).  This collection was the most successful of the competitors to ‘Hymns Ancient and Modern’ in the late nineteenth century, containing a larger number of hymns overall, and more hymns specifically intended for children and young people.
Rev. Charles Kemble’s ‘A Selection of Psalms and Hymns, arranged for the public services of the Church of England’ was first published in 1853 in a words-only edition.  Samuel Sebastian Wesley (1810–76) was asked to edit a music edition (1864), to which he contributed a number of original melodies.

Transcript of the diaries of Henry Croswell

### comment


It is not known who transcribed Croswell’s diaries, or when.  The British Library record was created in 1960.  The pages are unnumbered, but most records are individually numbered.  Record numbers have therefore been used in place of page numbers, where available.  A further transcript of the diaries is held at the Bodleian Library.
