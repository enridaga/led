### has_evidence_text


Some negotiations had now to be undertaken with the Zulu nation, and General Sir Evelyn Wood was entrusted with them. He took with him three squadrons of cavalry and a full band. [W]e saw many evidences of the numerous fights that had taken place, especially at the fatal field of Isandlana.[W]e found the Zulu army formed up in a huge crescent, their chiefs at their head, ready for the palaver. The general ordered the band to play 'God Save the Queen' and the men to give a cheer. As we did this, the Zulus half rose in an almost threatening way. There seemed to be some hitch in the negotiations, for the chiefs remained very grave and quiet. At last an order came for the bandmaster to strike up something lively, and he, being an Irishman, treated them to 'Patrick's day in the Morning'. Never have I seen any tune produce such a magical effect as this one did. First a few Zulus rose, then a few more, and then the whole lot, as if the Pied Piper of Hamelin was after them, and they could not help themselves. In less than five minutes the whole of that dusky host were swaying and dancing to the music. Above all things, they admired the big drummer, who could sit on his horse, and whack out such a fine tune. In the end the negotations were successfully completed, and the Zulu army left us with every token of amity.
