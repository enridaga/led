GARDNER, of Leicester, writes: \"At the hazard of my ribs, I placed myself at the Opera two hours and a half before the concert began The concert opened with BEETHOVEN'S second symphony, admirably played by the Philharmonic band, after which LABLACHE sang 'Largo al Factotum' with much applause, and was encored. A breathless silence, and every eye was watching the action of this extraordinary violinist; and as he glided from the side scenes to the front of the stage, an involuntary cheering burst from every part of the house, many rising from their scats to view the Spectre during the thunder of this unprecedented cheering his gaunt and extraordinary appearance being more like that of a devotee about to suffer martyrdom than one to delight you with his art. With the tip of his bow he sent off the orchestra in a grand military movement with a force and vivacity as surprising as it was new. At the termination of this introduction he commenced with a soft streaming note of celestial quality, and with three or four whips of his bow elicited points of sound that mounted to the third heaven and as bright as the stars... He has long legs and arms, and his hands in his playing often assume the attitude of prayer, with the fingers pointed upwards. It was curious to watch the faces of LINDLEY, DIAGONETTI, and the other great players, who took up places on the platform to command a good view of him during his performance they all seem to have agreed that </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;\"><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;\">the like had never been heard before, and that in addition to his marvellous eccentricities and novel effects, he had transcended the highest level of legitimate art that had ever been reached.\"</span></p>"^^rdf:HTML;
