GARDNER, of Leicester, writes: "At the hazard of my ribs, I placed myself at the Opera two hours and a half before the concert began The concert opened with BEETHOVEN'S second symphony, admirably played by the Philharmonic band, after which LABLACHE sang 'Largo al Factotum' with much applause, and was encored. A breathless silence, and every eye was watching the action of this extraordinary violinist; and as he glided from the side scenes to the front of the stage, an involuntary cheering burst from every part of the house, many rising from their scats to view the Spectre during the thunder of this unprecedented cheering his gaunt and extraordinary appearance being more like that of a devotee about to suffer martyrdom than one to delight you with his art.
