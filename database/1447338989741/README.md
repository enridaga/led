### value


<p>I remember the opening of the South Bank complex as part of the Festival of Britain in 1951 - I went to the events with my fiance on a break from university.&nbsp; I also had the honour of representing my county in the demonstration games of netball on the site.&nbsp; Since then, I have been a regular attender of concerts in the Festival Hall, the Elizabeth Hall and Purcell Room (have actually performed there!).</p>
