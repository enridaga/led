### comment


Spitalfields Festival ECP musicians performed 33 informal concerts at the out-patients department, Royal London Hospital. Percussionist Chris Brannick and poet Sean Taylor worked with pupils at Cherry Trees School for boys with emotional and behavioural difficulties to make a performance of music, poetry and stories. Pupils from East End primary schools took part in workshops with CHROMA who introduced their instruments and a range of water-inspired music spanning 300 years. Pupils attended CHROMA’s Spitalfields summer concert to hear and join in the aquatic music.

### comment


The Spitalfields Festival has been, since 1976, a major professional music event in the East End of London. Listening experiences relate to the Festival’s Education and Community Programme (ECP), launched in 1989. It devises education projects with schools and community groups that reflect these groups’ concepts and practices of the arts. The ECP is collaborative, linking musicians, writers and visual artists, and the Spitalfields Festival, with East End of London children, adults and elderly people.
