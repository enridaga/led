<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 150%; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">[Letter from Jemima Yorke to Mary Gregory, 29<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;January 1747]</span></strong></p>
<p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 0cm 7.5pt;">I should tell you too of a new Opera which is the most marvellous of all Strange Things. It is called Phaeton &amp; is entirely filled with Chorus' &amp; Dances join'd together after the Manner of the French Operas; the Dancers riding in upon Dolphins &amp; Sea-Hobby-Horses, &amp; poor Sodi tumbled like Jonas out of a Whale's Belly. A few of the Chorusses (which literally are Half the Opera) are pretty enough, but being sung by three or four Squalling Men &amp; Women out of Tune in One Corner of the Stage, &amp; as many bad Chorus-Dancers hopping about the middle of it at the same Time, they lose all their Effect. Add to this Account some Squibs by way of Fire-works, some very fine Painted Scenes, &amp; leave Musick absolutely out, &ndash; &amp; you will have an Idea of the Opera. I wish I could send you the Book, it is really very pretty Reading, better by Half than the Farce. But should you expect to hear that Old Borosini appears in it, I suppose he wants a little Money, or he would not care to shew how much he is changed since he was upon the Stage before. However his Figure though it represents Age is still graceful,&amp; his distinct expressive manner of Singing &amp; Speaking (if you are pleased so as to hear him well) is more agreable to me than any of the Others. Whether even all this Puppet-Show Work will make an Opera the Fashion this Winter I don't know, if it does not, the Expenses have been so absurdly great (they say) in Scenes &amp; Dresses that L.d M: must break I imagine &amp; may be reduced to set up Operas again in Italy for his Livelihood instead of his Diversion.</p>
