<p>I have been coming to the RFH since the late Fifties. I remember my husband whom I met then who was an avid Fan since it had been built in 1950 (I think it was). Our first date was at the RFH and we saw not a concert but a Russian Film of the opera Eugene Onegin. My husband was of Polish Origin and in the sixties we saw a lot of gigs of Polish and Ukrainian Dancers and Singers. My&nbsp; husband has sadly died but I still go to the RFH. Programmes are varied, from Classical to Rock 'N Roll and I like that. I also discovered the free Programmes on Sunday lunchtimes which are great fun. I have been ill so haven't been for a while, but once you are re-opened I shall certainly become a regular visitor once more.</p>
