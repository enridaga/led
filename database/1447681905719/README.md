<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">Having just arrived in London in 1956 from Hungary following the foiled uprising there, I was soon captivated by the - then - space age experience of this vast, magical bubble of music making.&nbsp; As a medical student of limited means, I became a regular visitor to the choir stalls for 5 shillings (25p) a throw. Best experiences were Stephen Bishop (Kovacevich) playing the Diabelli Variations on a Sunday afternoon and Yasha Horenstein with Shubert.&nbsp;</p>
