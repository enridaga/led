### comment


John Evans-Pughe (1925 to 1996) was a chorister (with his younger brother Tom) at the choir of the College of St Nicholas, Chislehurst, under Sir Sydney Nicholson and later a music scholar at Kings School Canterbury, Kent. The St Nicholas choir was recorded for many BBC broadcasts and for Columbia Records. A Columbia recording in 1939 featuring John Evans-Pughe and Michael Lumb as treble soloists singing O Lovely Peace (Handel) and Brother Jamesâ€™ Air (arr. Jacob) was a best seller. 
John did National Service in Egypt and Greece, and then studied science at Trinity College, Dublin. He went on to became an electronics engineer for Marconi Space and Defence Systems, continuing with music in his spare time.

<p>TO: The Rev. J and Mrs. Evans-Pughe, Tovil Vicarage, Maidstone, Kent</p>
<p>FROM: John Evans-Pughe, ON ACTIVE SERVICE, Cairo, Egypt, 1407&hellip;</p>
<p>DATE: Thur 16th [month?] 1947</p>
<p>&hellip;I spent from 11.30 &ndash; 1.00 to-day queueing for tickets at the Cairo Opera House but all in vain &ndash; it shut at 1.00 when I was about 5 places from the front&hellip;</p>
<p>I went to the Symphony concert with my A.T.S friend on the 9th, it was very good: I&rsquo;m going to try to get a copy of the Bach Concerto in E &ndash; I like it very much.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not sure whether I sent you the other programme before: the best parts of it were Cesar Franck and the Chausson &ndash; the rest of the stuff was a bit &ldquo;Picassoish&rdquo; in my opinion.&nbsp; The songs by Schiffer and Petry were completely atonal&nbsp; - no key at all: the two efforts by Dr. Hickman however were very very good in contrast to the others&hellip;</p>
