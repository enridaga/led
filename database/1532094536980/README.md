Now Freddie was a nice young man, his head was like a warming pan, and every night he had a plan to go and visit Miss Judy Gann; now Judy Gann run home to roost, and bumped her head against a post, and then the fool gave up the ghost, to wait on Teddy the tailor&rdquo;. How we used to laugh. Then he would sing about Nancy, and this is it &ldquo;How sweet is the morn and loud blows the horn, and through the fields we&rsquo;ll go &ndash; o, for all me fancy dwells on Nancy, and I&rsquo;ll sing&nbsp;Talli &ndash; Ho &ndash; o&rdquo; and then we would laugh again, and perhaps he would sing &ldquo;Old King Cole&rdquo; and I have never heard anyone sing it like he did.&nbsp;</span></p>

### comment


The reminiscences of Minnie Frisby (1877-1953) (née Jones) describe her rural childhood and early adult life, 1880s-1951, in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire. It was written in a number of sittings, usually on the author’s birthday. The document is sub-headed Book 1, pp. I.1 – I.21 (written 1942- 1943) and Book 2, pp. II.1 – II.27 (written 1943-1951). The unpublished account is held in The Burnett Archive of Working Class Autobiographies, gathered together by John Burnett, David Vincent and David Mayall whilst compiling their three volumes annotated bibliography, "The Autobiography of the Working Class" (Harvester Press, 1984-1989).
