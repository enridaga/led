[performance of ''On Spital Fields' community cantata'](#performance-of-''On-Spital-Fields'-community-cantata')

### comment


The aim of the ‘On Spital Fields’ project was to devise, rehearse and perform a community cantata involving older people, adults and children from Tower Hamlets and a team of professional musicians and animateurs. The twelve pieces comprising the cantata tell the story of Spitalfields, based on fictional texts and historical documents relating to East End London. Makers included composer Jonathan Dove, librettist Alasdair Middleton, Gerry Cornelius conductor and Clare Whistler, director. Pupils from Osmani and St Anne’s primary schools and Mulberry School for Girls formed the children’s choirs (pupils from additional local schools participated in workshops to develop the project). Also performing were the Wessex Singers (Tower Hamlet’s choir for the over 50’s), The Joyful Company of Singers, an SATB choir and a community chorus, students from the Royal Academy of Music and Chroma Ensemble. The Society of Royal Cumberland Youths rang the bells of Christ Church, Spitalfields, its completed restoration celebrated by ‘On Spital Fields’, before both evening performances on 22 and 23 June 2005. 

Dove’s score is dedicated to Christopher Robert Vaughan (1961-1999), a passionate supporter of Spitalfields Festival. Vaughan left a legacy that helped to fund ‘On Spital Fields’. The community cantata was intended to celebrate Vaughan’s life.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: Cambria, serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">[Letter dated 24 June 2005]</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: Cambria, serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">[&hellip;] I couldn&rsquo;t let today go by without letting you, Alasdair Middleton [librettist], and everyone else involved know how profoundly I was affected by &lsquo;On Spital Fields&rsquo;.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: Cambria, serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: Cambria, serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">One reason for this was, of course, that this is a hugely powerful piece of work in its own right. I will say more about that in a moment. A second reason is more personal: that the evening so potently brought together themes&mdash;the locality, music, education, story&mdash;that have been central to my own life for many years. Third, the piece was a wonderful example of democratic, community creativity. For an hour and a bit, many of the divisions and difficulties that take up so much of our time and energy seemed simply to dissolve away.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: Cambria, serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">[&hellip;]</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: Cambria, serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Throughout the performance (and especially to me what was certainly a&nbsp;<em>Dies Irae</em>), I was reminded of what you had said about a requiem mass. Almost by definition, a requiem takes us beyond time and place, and I think that somewhere in and around &lsquo;On Spital Fields&rsquo; there is a requiem that belongs, not just to a small part of East London, but to the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
