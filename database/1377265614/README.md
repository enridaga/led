BEGINNING OF LETTER:

I wish it was in my Power & had sufficient time to give you some adequate Idea of the Reception, our worthy President met with, on his Arrival in this City — The Pen of a Hervey could not do ample Justice, on this interesting Occasion — A Committee or rather a deputation from both Houses of Congress, were appointed to meet him on the Jersey Shore — This they did at Elizabeth Town on the 23d Instant — They were conducted the Day before to Elizabeth Town-point in a most elegant Barge, about 47 feet long, with a very elegant awning & highly finished — She was rowed with 13 Oars by 13 of the Branch Pilotts of this Port, under the direction of Cap. Thomas Randall of this City who generously & eagerly undertook the pleasing Task — This Barge was built by a Number of Citizens for this very Purpose, and which they mean to compliment the President with.

RELEVANT SECTION

Before the Barge reached Bedlers Island, a large Sloop came up with full sail, and about 20 Gentn. & Ladies appeared upon Deck & with excellent Voices, sang an Ode prepared for the Purpose, to the Tune of “God save the King” welcoming their great Chief to the seat of Government — About a Mile farther on, another Boat came along side, in which were about a dozen Gentn. who sang another Ode to the same Purpose.
This good Man was greatly affected with these Tokens of affectionate Respect — When near the harbour, the train increased with Huzzaing & Shouts of Joy, which seemed to add Life to this lively Scene — at this Moment a number of Porpoises came playing amongst the Boats, as if desirous to know the Cause of so great Triumph — The Shores appeared crowded with Thousands, nay it may justly be said, with Tens of Thousands of People — 

END
