Thomas Randall of this City who generously & eagerly undertook the pleasing Task — This Barge was built by a Number of Citizens for this very Purpose, and which they mean to compliment the President with.\r\n\r\nRELEVANT SECTION\r\n\r\nBefore the Barge reached Bedlers Island, a large Sloop came up with full sail, and about 20 Gentn. & Ladies appeared upon Deck & with excellent Voices, sang an Ode prepared for the Purpose, to the Tune of “God save the King” welcoming their great Chief to the seat of Government — About a Mile farther on, another Boat came along side, in which were about a dozen Gentn. who sang another Ode to the same Purpose.\r\nThis good Man was greatly affected with these Tokens of affectionate Respect — When near the harbour, the train increased with Huzzaing & Shouts of Joy, which seemed to add Life to this lively Scene — at this Moment a number of Porpoises came playing amongst the Boats, as if desirous to know the Cause of so great Triumph — The Shores appeared crowded with Thousands, nay it may justly be said, with Tens of Thousands of People — \r\n\r\nEND\r\n"@en;
