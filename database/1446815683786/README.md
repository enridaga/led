<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">Meltdown 2004 &hellip;&hellip; Morrisey is my one and only. My favourite. I saw him perform at all 3 concerts he was playing himself. The setting was beautiful with a Las Vegas twist. The retro look of the QEH was perfect. On my way home, whenever I cross the river, I see the QEH and sigh when I remember those 3 concerts that made my summer. Perfect concert, perfect artist, perfect setting.</p>
