*Excerpt*

### value


<p>Of his [Millico] merits I can say nothing but that his reputation was still high in Italy when I was in that country many years afterwards. He published here a collection of canzonettas, which are of a most pleasing and graceful style. These I frequently heard executed by Lady Clarges, who had been his scholar, and was one of the best amateur performers I ever knew. She sung with all the science of a professor, and with a taste the most polished and refined. If she had adopted that of her master, there can be no doubt of his having been an excellent singer.</p>
