<p>A few years ago my friends and i saw jamie cullum (who i was completely in love with) for the first time.&nbsp; we had brilliant seats and were very impressed by his performance.&nbsp; forgetting to monitor the time for our last train home, i suddenly looked at my watch and realised we would miss the train if we didn't leave before the end.&nbsp; i was naturally heartbroken at missing the finale but we dashed out of the building and had to sprint across the bridge in the pouring rain and in 3 inch heels towards charing cross.&nbsp; when we got there breathless and worn out, we found our train had been delayed by half an hour so we could have stayed to the end anyway!&nbsp; typical!</p>
