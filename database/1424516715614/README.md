<p>Although I remember seeing the Royal Festival Hall being built my most endearing memory was scketching (sic) Frank Sinatra from the audience. He was in a very playful mood between the songs and I was trying to make sketches without him noticing what I was doing. He was the most amazing performer that I have ever seen, a real legend. There will never be another Frank Sinatra.</p>
