### comment


The first half of volume 1 was written by Thomas Holcroft, covering only the first sixteen years of his life. William Hazlitt completed the memoir using Holcroft’s diary, notes and other papers, adding commentary. Hazlitt explains in the introduction to volume 1, ‘Mr. Holcroft had intended, for several years before his death, to write an account of his life […] I first became acquainted with Mr. Holcroft about ten years ago; my chief intercourse with him was within the last three or four years of his life’.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">[I]t appears that Mr Holcroft, among other employments [&hellip;] found time to write songs for Vauxhall, several of which became very popular. Among these, the greatest favourite was the ballad beginning &ldquo;Down the Bourne and through the Mead&rdquo;, which was set to music by Shield. This song, which is written in the Scottish dialect, has often been taken for an old Scotch ballad, and has been actually printed in a collection of Scotch songs.&mdash; Mr Holcroft was one evening drinking tea with some friends at [pleasure gardens] White-Conduit House, when the organ was playing the tune of Johnny and Mary. After they had listened some time, a person in the next box began to descant rather learnedly on the beauty of the Scotch airs, and the tenderness and simplicity of their popular poetry, bringing this very ballad as an illustration of his argument, neither the words or music of which, he said, any one now living was capable of imitating. Mr Holcroft on this, took occasion to remark the strange force of prejudice, and turning to the gentleman, interrupted his argument by informing him, that he himself was the author of the song in question, and that the tune was composed by his friend, Mr. Shield, who I believe was also there present.&nbsp;</span></p>
