<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">As a school child (born 1941) I was taken to the Ernest Read Children's Concerts. These made an indelible impression, as did a filmed presentation of Richard Strauss's "Der Rosenkavalier". In the subsequent years as a young adult everything about the Festival Hall, its accessibility, design and position (magical at night with London lights reflected in the Thames) made it a "best treat" venue for myself and friends.&nbsp;</p>
