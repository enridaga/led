<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">The Ether Festival (24th March 2006) was a brilliant event. I had an array of artists that we couldn't even all see. I will always remember it as my first electro concert - with the brilliant Ladytron among others, as somewhere I met some lovely people who I still see and as an event that helped me through the pressures I was experiencing at the time. Thanks you for a brilliant event that will stay with me for a long time.</p>
