### comment


It may be of interest to state that three generations of my family took part in the music: My father sang tenor in the choir, my son joined the trebles, and I played the organ and conducted. (Bridge's footnote)

<p>June 2 ist, 1887, was a gloriously beautiful day, and as such is surely still enshrined in the memories of thousands glorious from its associations, beautiful because a perfect day of an English summer. For us at the Abbey all went well, the glorious interior looking magnificent as the distinguished gathering thronged the tiers of improvised galleries, and, assembled from every corner of the earth, our race proclaimed its great day of festival and exultation. A day or two after the event I was invited to the garden party at Buckingham Palace, when, as Her Majesty passed with her suite through the crowd, I was accosted unexpectedly by the Lord Chamberlain and presented to the Queen, who was very kind, saying: "The music was most successful, every one was extremely pleased." A few days later I received the Jubilee Medal, and also the following letter from Sir Ponsonby Fane : "DEAR DR. BRIDGE, I must write you a line to say how splendidly your music went yesterday. I shall always have a most pleasant recollection of our communications and collaborations on this interesting ceremony, which thank Heaven, has been so successful. Yours very truly, S. PONSONBY FANE. Dean Bradley also wrote to me in the following kind terms: "DEAR DR. BRIDGE, Please to allow me to express to you on paper my grateful sense of all you have done to secure the success of both our Jubilee Services. The task of bringing together such a choir was in itself no light one, and I and all others are, I am sure, deeply grateful to you both for the successful completion of that task and for all else that you have done. My words are few, but they come, I assure you, from my heart. Most truly yours, G. BRADLEY.</p>
