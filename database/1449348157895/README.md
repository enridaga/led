<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I remember, as a primary schoolkid of eight, being taken to a Robert Mayer children's concert - my first concert ever, but it kicked-off many decades of concert-going for me.&nbsp; I think it might have included Benjamin Britten's A Child's Guide to the Orchestra, but I know that it was a magical experience.</p>
