The heat was intense; I never experienced anything like it: at night it is fearful, I cannot sleep for it. Our beds are three under one punkah…. In the other rooms they are as crowded, but it is nothing to the Residency. Our party here is a very agreeable one. We meet at chota hazree, and, after dressing, breakfast at 10. We then have working, reading and music - there are some very good performers amongst our party – lunch at 2, dine at half-past 7, and then the Padre reads a chapter and prayers, and we retire.
