<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I was 11 years old in 1951 and was taken for the first time to see the ballet at the newly opened Festival Hall, but the high point was a meal in the restaurant.&nbsp; It was my first grand meal out, I think, and the restaurant seemed so grand and so full of light from the enormous windows looking onto the river. Then between 1955 and 1959 I came up with my school choir to take part in the Ernest Read concerts.&nbsp; We sat on stage as performers and the whole experience was thrilling, especially exploring back stage, whizzing through the pass doors and feeling an important part of such a wonderful experience.&nbsp; As a teacher later on I brought parties of schoolchildren to listen to the Ernest Read concerts and they were fabulous.&nbsp; is there anything similar now?</p>
