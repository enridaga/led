The family assembled in a large room, denuded of its carpet, that the musical sounds might be heard to greater advantage. Our host being an accomplished violinist, and each member of his family playing some stringed instrument, there was here material for the performance of much excellent chamber music. First we had a classical overture, arranged as a duet for the pianoforte and a string quartet; then a violin solo, one of those charming romances by the old Italian masters, lately reprinted in Leipzig ; then a Trio of Beethoven&rsquo;s, for pianoforte, violin, and violoncello ; then some vocal music, and for a finale, another overture arranged as the first. Rarely have I heard, even amongst professional musicians, better music better rendered, or more thoroughly enjoyed</span></p>
