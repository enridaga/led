<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">In 1953 when I was at the Raglan Junior School, Bush Hill Park; the Headmistress Miss Berry and class teacher Miss Francis obtained 6 season tickets for the Robert Mayer concerts. I was fortunate to be included 2 years running and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. In the 1980s, I was living in Abingdon and my 2 boys were 7 and 9. I discovered the concerts still existed. So with my neighbour I would take the boys on the train to London. They also enjoyed the concerts and went on to play in school and college orchestras.</p>
