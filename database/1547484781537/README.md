### comment


Henry Croswell (1840–93) kept a record of his visits to churches in London over a period of more than twelve years (1872–85).  He made methodical notes about the number of clergy, the churchmanship, the congregation, the sermon and the church architecture, as well as commenting on the music that he heard (the organ, the hymns and the choir).  The above listening experience has been extracted from one of these records.
The rector of St Stephen's, Walbrook, at the time of Croswell's visit was William Windle.  The hymnal he edited, ‘The Church and Home Metrical Psalter and Hymn Book’, was published in a music edition revised by George Cooper in 1862.

### comment


It is not known who transcribed Croswell’s diaries, or when.  The British Library record was created in 1960.  The pages are unnumbered, but most records are individually numbered.  Record numbers have therefore been used in place of page numbers, where available.  A further transcript of the diaries is held at the Bodleian Library.
