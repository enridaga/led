<p class="MsoNormal">My dear Harriot,&mdash;I think you will like to hear of the Coronation [of William IV], as you had so many friends acting in it. I went there as a spectator, with Miss Fox, Caroline and Horatia Feilding, and Tom Strangways, who undertook to take care of us. Uncle John Strangways and Stephen joined us at the Abbey. Papa walked in the procession as President of the Council, and his coronet was carried by Stavordale. We were so sorry that my brother Henry was not here, as he would have enjoyed it so much. Uncle Harry [Earl of Ilchester] was, of course, in his place as a peer, and we saw him do homage very well. Mamma was in her place as a peeress, but had also (which you may suppose she did not much like) to carry the pall over the Queen during the crowning and anointing, with the Duchesses of Richmond and Northumberland, and another, whose name I forget. Theresa&rsquo;s co-partners you have probably heard, as they were named in all the newspapers. She and mamma ended their day by dining at St. James&rsquo;s Palace. Kerry [Earl of Kerry, eldest son of Lord Lansdowne] held the King&rsquo;s train, instead of Lord Lincoln, who was ill. So I had plenty of friends to watch for. We did not go very early, so we had not a very good place; we were in the south transept, behind the peers, and therefore saw the peeresses very well, but we saw nothing that went on near the altar.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">Some of the music was beautiful. I am glad to have seen it, but I do not wish to see another. It is a strange mixture of mummery and of what ought to be more serious.</span></p>
