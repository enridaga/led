 - <p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">There are several very important things I must tell you about yesterday&rsquo;s rehearsal of the chamber symphony. / First the good points: the thing as a whole seems to have been worked out pretty well. Except for some casual and some wrong rhythms and some passages that don&rsquo;t come out at all, almost everything else would make an excellent impression if it were not that/ (and now come the bad points, which I must state most emphatically and which I wish you to pay the utmost attention to) <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">your</em> <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">tempi were much too fast throughout</em>./ You seem to labour under the delusion that temperament means speed!! But temperament in itself doesn&rsquo;t mean anything and so far as I&rsquo;m concerned, if it means &lsquo;fiery temperament&rsquo; or the like, it strikes me as worthless, because the most it can do is to impress the womenfolk. Cast off this error and make music with a muted, with a restrained temperament!! / Now for the details: in general, then, this rushing of tempi means losing all the clarity gained by careful study of the score. All the lines become blurred and one can&rsquo;t understand a thing! / For instance, the first part of the Scherzo is too fast by more than half. The same for the Trio: / That simply won&rsquo;t do. It must go much slower. / But the main thing is the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Adagio</em>: you take it almost allegro!!! Of course it mustn&rsquo;t be treacly slow, but must have an inward emotion, only adagio, (about 50)!!! Then the B major part of the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Adagio</em> much too fast!! This begins quietly and contemplatively, and its intensification must <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">not </em>be <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">passionate</em>, but &lsquo;inwardness intensified&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s a remarkable thing: passion&rsquo;s something everyone can do! But inwardness, the chaste, higher form of emotion, seems to be out of most people&rsquo;s reach. On the whole it&rsquo;s understandable: for the underlying emotion must be felt and not merely demonstrated! This too is why all actors have passion and only a very few have inwardness. / I can&rsquo;t regard it with tolerance! / To go on: the whole recapitulation section is rushed. It&rsquo;s all fluffed, no note is left clear. Do use only as much expression as in in the piece, and don&rsquo;t always try to give more! / I beg you to observe these criticisms exactly, if you want to remain on good terms with me!!!(&hellip;) I hope you won&rsquo;t be foolish enough to be cross with me for these strong words. But I have come to realise that bad performances do me so much harm that I can&rsquo;t go on allowing them. I always used to console myself with thoughts of the future. But recently I have been feeling more and more that every inadequate performance of a work of art is a grave crime, simply immoral. </span></p>
