<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I was a music student in London (studying piano with Ilona Kabos and at the R.C.M.) in the fifties. So I was lucky enough to be at the opening concert in the F.H. It was an electrifying experience but we all thought the acoustic was too dry. I remember it was a J.S.Bach concert and you could hear a pin drop. The sound engineer had quite a struggle to remedy this lack of harmonic reverberation. We used to sit on the platform on the left of the pianist for half-a-crown! (25p now?) There's a very special place in my heart for F.H. so come on 2007!</p>
