If I didn&rsquo;t play a solo with all the tenderness, or charm, or brio with which some great singer had sung it, he would stop me over and over again. &ldquo;No, no, you haven&rsquo;t got it; don&rsquo;t you remember the splendid virility with which he simply brought the house down with such and such an aria?

There was something emotional in it that appealed to the youth in me, and I loved to try and make the piano a living and breathing human voice.

Perhaps the actual music only stirred me on the surface - still, even surfaces are facts that cannot be denied, and have to be reckoned with.
