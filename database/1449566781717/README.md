 - <p>In the summer of &rsquo;88, I spent a part of the season in Paris. Sivori was still alive, and, like the majority of artists who lead the lives of virtuosi, had made Paris his home. I determined to do myself the honor of calling on him, and had an opportunity to do so in company with a Boston friend who knew him well. Sivori was living on the fourth or fifth story of a very modest hotel, having a single room, with space for an upright piano and an alcove for his bed. It was a charming, cosy little room, just such a one as the majority of bachelor artists occupy in Paris, no matter how ample their income; and in these quarters they receive the visits of princes and people of the haute noblesse.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I let my friend, who was intimate with Sivori, do the talking for some time, while I watched all the artist&rsquo;s motions. He was a rather small-sized man, and had very small hands for a violinist, at which I marvelled, for his distinction was based on his being a Paganini player; and we all know that the music of that composer requires the fingers of a prestidigitator. As we progressed in our call I nudged my friend (according to previous agreement) to tell Sivori I was a member of the Mendelssohn Quintette Club of Boston, and that I wanted very much to see the famous &ldquo; Strad,&rdquo; the inheritance from Paganini. Sivori was amiability itself.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">[&hellip;]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sivori took out the violin from its case. It was a perfect &ldquo; Kohinoor &rdquo; of an instrument, just the right color, and perfectly preserved,&mdash; not a scratch or a crack,&mdash;with the great seal of red sealing-wax on the under part of the violin where the neck begins. I told Mr. Sivori that I heard him in his first concert given in the old Masonic Temple in Boston (where R. H. Steams &amp; Co.&rsquo;s store now is), that I was an enthusiastic boy at the time, and that his playing had made such an impression on me that I could name the pieces he played in that concert, though there was an interim of about forty years. I named them,&mdash;the E-flat concerto (his own composition), La Campanile by Paga&not;nini, and the Most in Egitto, also by Paganini.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The old artist opened his bookcase, took out a book containing an itinerary of musical tourndes made in his younger days, and turned at once to Boston. I had named the pieces exactly, and he was highly pleased. He played for us a great deal, and it was a joy to hear the tone of that violin; it was also impossible not to be affected by the sentiment connected with it. Paganini&rsquo;s violin! the instrument of that strange and wonderful player, the wizard of the concert stage, who had conquered all musical Europe</p>
