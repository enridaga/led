### has_evidence_text


We were cheered by the news that a Sepoy of the 1st Oude Irregulars, who had been sent out by the Brigadier, had returned; he had lost the letter from the relieving force, but had been in their campâ€¦. He said they had four European regiments and one Sikh one; and that one European regiment had a curious baja (music) played in front of them - meaning the bagpipes.
