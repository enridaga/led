<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I remember as a music student at the RAM, going with friends to the recently opened RFH to hear Horowitz in an evening recital. I had a wonderful view on the keyboard side looking down from above on what to me seemed a man possessed by a spirit. His playing was quite unlike anything I had heard before. He played Scarlatti, Chopin, Liszt - and afterwards showed surprise at the enthusiasm of the applause. It was quite unforgettable. He sat quite low at the piano with his wrists well below the keys - quite unlike the curled fingers Matthay technique I was being taught. Many other glorious events: The Matthew Passion, Pollini, sitting a few feet away and in '94 Mikhail Pletnev who made me feel I had never heard the Emperor before. And he came onto the platform chatting to the conductor.</p>
