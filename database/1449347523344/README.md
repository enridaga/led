<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">We have so many memories it is difficult to make a choice.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">However, our first must be 1st June 1953, the night before the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp;We were part of a Charity Group that arranged one of the earliest Charity Balls at the RFH which we called the Coronation Ball. It was held in the foyer ballroom with Joe Loss &amp; Edmundo Ros and was a fantastic success.&nbsp;In 1971 we saw Frank Sinatra, introduced by Princess Grace &ndash; a wonderful, wonderful night, and in recent years we attended a recital by Itzak Perlman and Bruno Canino (could it have been in 27 October, 2004 &ndash; it seems longer). As we sat in the front row immediately facing him, it was an evening of sheer magic.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">We have so many more and cannot wait for it to re-open.</p>
