### comment


John Evans-Pughe (1925 to 1996) was a chorister (with his younger brother Tom) at the choir of the College of St Nicholas, Chislehurst, under Sir Sydney Nicholson and later a music scholar at Kings School Canterbury, Kent. The St Nicholas choir was recorded for many BBC broadcasts and for Columbia Records. A Columbia recording in 1939 featuring John Evans-Pughe and Michael Lumb as treble soloists singing O Lovely Peace (Handel) and Brother Jamesâ€™ Air (arr. Jacob) was a best seller. 
John did National Service in Egypt and Greece, and then studied science at Trinity College, Dublin. He went on to became an electronics engineer for Marconi Space and Defence Systems, continuing with music in his spare time.

<p>TO: The Rev. J and Mrs. Evans-Pughe, Tovil Vicarage, Maidstone, Kent</p>
<p>FROM: John Evans-Pughe, College of St. Nicholas, Chislehurst, Kent</p>
<p>POSTMARK: 29 March 1939</p>
<p>Dear Mummy and Daddy</p>
<p>Thank you very much for the letters.&nbsp; It will be quite safe to send Tom&rsquo;s cake, if you put a label on the parcel with &ldquo;Perishable&rdquo; written on it&hellip;.</p>
<p>&hellip;On Friday night (Boy&rsquo;s service) the organ motor didn&rsquo;t work properly.&nbsp; When the chant was being played over sometimes it played just the treble and alto, other times Bass only, other times just the underneath parts, and all kinds of different combinations, but usually it left out the treble.&nbsp; Everybody was bursting with laughter, especially Mr. Barnes; nobody could sing; you just heard a few notes from one or two of us now and then, and then everyone kept bursting out with laughter and had to stop.&nbsp; It was too funny for words,&nbsp; and it was a blind man playing, and he kept trying to tell Mr. Barnes that it wouldn&rsquo;t play, but Mr. Barnes was laughing too much to answer.&nbsp; The Chaplain told us to say the Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis, and Mr. Barnes went out to switch off the organ&hellip;</p>
