<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">As a student at the UCL I attended the college Comemoration Ball with my girlfriend (name forgotten) in May 1957. I wore my first D.J. (dinner Jacket). &nbsp;I had it &nbsp;made by Babludow's back home in Wallasey Cheshire. We danced (me not very well) the night away and had our photograph taken posing on the staircase. A memorable night.</p>
