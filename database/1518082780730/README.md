<p>[25th March 1829] This a great holyday, Lady-day. High mass was performed with great pomp, this morning, at the church of <em>Santa Annunziata</em>. The royal family all went there and returned in full procession. While they were in church, the royal family sat under a canopy, or tent rather, open on the side facing the altar. The four corners of the tent were guarded by four officers in regimentals, with broad-swords drawn and plumed cocked-hats on their heads. There were a good many soldiers in the church, who kept their heads covered all the while. The ceremony was a mixture of the sacred and the military. It was what is called a <em>military mass</em>. There were the priests chanting at the altar; and the soldiers, who bore their arms, grounded them when they knelt, the butts of their muskets making a great rattle against the stone floor of the church. It did not look well to see the soldiers all keeping their heads covered. They could not, in such a place, be said to be <em>on duty</em>; unless, indeed, the church had been besieged. Among the musicians there were several red-coated performers, and these blew trumpets and beat drums, which took the loudest parts in the concert. The blasts of war prevailed over the seraphic sounds of peace; it seemed as if the musical sons of Mars were putting the choir of St. Cecilia to a complete rout.</p>
