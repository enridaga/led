On calling for that wine, our host asked, <em>Bulite roba buona</em>?* which of course was answered in the affirmative. [&hellip;] But to return to the <em>Lachrime Christi.</em> That of our host's was so delicious, that, in spite of my physician's injunctions, the second bottle soon became a <em>desideratum</em>, and my friend now grew more jovial than ever I saw him, and perhaps than ever he had been in his life. He would give a specimen of his voice, and favoured the host and your humble servant with the pretty air, " <em>Sul margine d'un rio</em>." To do him justice in this vocal attempt, he would probably have succeeded to admiration, had he not taken some unwarrantable liberties with the sharps and flats; one of which he would substitute for the other so frequently, that at the end of his cantata, he was not only a full fifth lower than when he began, but it was also impossible to guess whether the melody was in a minor or major key: as to time, the whole was given, <em>ad libitum</em>, without any servile adherence to bars or stops. On being pressed, in my turn, to sing an English air, I first begged my friend to stand up, and mine host to pull off his night-cap, and then began "God save the King," with the utmost glee of loyalty and patriotism; feelings excited the more powerfully, in proportion to the distance which separates us from a beloved country and sovereign.</span></p>
