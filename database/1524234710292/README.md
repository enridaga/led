It was held at the Crystal Palace &amp; was an enjoyable holiday &amp; an inexpensive one as being on the R&rsquo;way I had a first class Pass altho&rsquo; my travelling expenses etc were paid. I greatly enjoyed the Solos, but the Choruses!! Ugh! It seemed to me as if I was surrounded by the Bulls of Bashan, the noise &amp; shouting being deafening. I could not hear myself &amp; did not trouble to sing very much. It was very different to my previous singing there 7 years before at the opening as a Boy.</span></p>
