Several young men were inside that house drinking and card playing, when, late at night, they fell out among themselves. The landlord turned them outside, when two of them, Harry Hewett and Edward Smith resumed the quarrel. After fighting a few minutes, Hewitt took out a knife and stabbed Smith, who died in consequence after about a quarter of an hour. [...] Hewett was lodged in Horsham Gaol to await his trial at the coming Horsham Assizes. The following verses were written on the occasion, and used to be sung about the town:

At the "Queen's Head" Inn in Horsham Town,
Poor Edward Smith met his death wound;
Drinking and gaming, and playing at cards,
Causes the best of friends to have words.

Drinking and gaming till twelve at night,
Then out in the street they went to fight;
Poor Smith thought he'd a friend so nigh,
But proved to be an enemy.

Young Hewett with his knife so sharp,
Aimed several times at poor Smith's heart,
He gave one stab, such a horrid deed,
Enough to make one's heart to bleed.

What could a mother be thinking on,
To stand near by and see her son
Engage in wicked, deadly, strife,
And rob his poor young friend of life.

The Horsham Assizes now draw near,
And at the bar Hewett must appear:
Before the Judge he now must stand,
With aching heart and trembling hand.

Young men! take warning by his plight,
Shun drink and cards by day and night,
Be honest, sober, kind, and free,
And so avoid such misery.
