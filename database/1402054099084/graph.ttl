I thought well, my brothers and my friends are in France, so a friend and I thought to ourselves, well, let's do something. So we wrote to London and asked for war work. And we were directed to a munitions factory at Perivale in London...\r\n     We had to do a fortnight on and a fortnight off. It was terribly hard, terribly monotonous, but we had a purpose... I was working with sailors’ wives from three ships that were torpedoed and sank Aboukir, Cressy and Hogue, on the 22nd of September 1914. It was pitiful to see them, so we had to cheer them up as best we could, so we sang. It was beautiful to listen to...\r\n     Each day we really and truly worked as I’ve never seen women work like it in my life before or since. It was just magic, we worked and we stood and we sat and we sang. If anyone had come into that factory they would never have believed it could have gone on, because we were such a happy band of women working amongst such treacherous conditions..."@en;
