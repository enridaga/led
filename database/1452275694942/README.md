*Excerpt*

### value

 - <p>One day I wandered into a church on the Nevsky Prospect, and there I heard the wonderful effect that can be obtained by a choir of Russian men. To my mind a fine bass or baritone is the most beautiful of all voices, and you certainly hear them to perfection all over Russia. I happened to mention the great beauty of the singing I had just heard in that church to a Russian friend with whom we were dining, and at the same time I mentioned a specially beautiful effect of the organ in conjunction with the voices.</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;But there is no organ in that church on the Nevsky Prospect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, there is,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;and what is more, I remember perfectly the quite beautiful effect of a deep pedal note as the men sang the melody above it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you, you are mistaken,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;What you thought was an organ note was the ensemble of the bass voices on one note. I have often heard that effect in the churches here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 12.55pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; margin: 0cm 56.0pt .0001pt 0cm;">I found it difficult to believe him, but it was, of course, quite true.</p>
