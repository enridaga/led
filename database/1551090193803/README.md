### comment


Henry Croswell (1840–93) kept a record of his visits to churches in London over a period of more than twelve years (1872–85).  He made methodical notes about the number of clergy, the churchmanship, the congregation, the sermon and the church architecture, as well as commenting on the music that he heard (the organ, the hymns and the choir).  The above listening experience has been extracted from one of these records.
‘Hymns Ancient and Modern for use in the Services of the Church’ (1861; Appendix, 1868; Second edition, 1875; Supplement, 1889) was envisaged as an anthology of the best hymns available and became the most widely-used hymnbook in the Church of England during the late nineteenth century.  William Henry Monk (1823–89) was musical editor.
Croswell’s observation about the pitch-pipe and Tate and Brady is cryptic (the editorial square brackets around the phrase were added by the transcriber, who was apparently puzzled by it].  ‘A New Version of the Psalms of David, Fitted to the Tunes Used in Churches’ by Nahum Tate and Nicholas Brady (1696) had become the standard psalter in use throughout the Church of England by the early nineteenth century.  Some editions also included hymns.  Did Croswell mean that ‘Hymns A&M’ had recently replaced Tate and Brady as the hymnal in use at St Thomas’ Church?  An alternative reading might be that the pitch-pipe, commonly used to give the note to singers in the absence of other musical instruments, was disguised as a psalter.  Such a practice is known to have been observed in the US by some Puritan churches that disapproved of the use of instruments in church.

### comment


It is not known who transcribed Croswell’s diaries, or when.  The British Library record was created in 1960.  The pages are unnumbered, but most records are individually numbered.  Record numbers have therefore been used in place of page numbers, where available.  A further transcript of the diaries is held at the Bodleian Library.
