        rdf:value   "<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;\">1951. Memorable events at the RFH I have personally experienced since the first event I attend since 1951, not necessarily in any order of sequence. The Verdi Requiem conducted by a French conductor of note whose name escapes my memory. Sir Edmund Hilary showing his Everest slides. Klemperer's Beethoven cycle with the Philharmonia. Giulini's Missa Solemnis (Beethoven) with the Philharmonia. Beecham's Mozart performances with the RPO. Tennstedt conducting Mahler with the LPO. Barbirolli's introducing me (and others?) to Mahler's No 3. The Amadeus playing Schubert 's Death and the Maiden and the quintet with Cecil Aronowicz. The three Brahms piano trios with Ashkenazi [Ashkenazy] and others. Last but far from least: Bruno Walter on 15th May 1955 with the BBC Symph. Orch. introducing Mahler's 'Lieder eines Fahrenden Gesellen' with Fischer-Dieskau, followed by the first Symphony. No doubt there are many more inc. Mr. Bean's 'Point counter Point' aptly juxtaposing different reviews of the same concert. I almost forgot the Brahms series of the Philharmonia in the nineties under Kurt Sanderling - so unforgettable I bought CDs of the series; incidentally Mitsuki Uchida's playing of the first piano concerto - Sturm and Drang indeed from a pianist renowned mainly for her Mozart playing. Althogether, great, wonderful memories to cherish!</p>"^^rdf:HTML;
