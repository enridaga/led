*Excerpt*

### value


<p>I had promised to go into the country and at the time of my going, your brother was just come down from London and I went down to the New Room in order to see him; because I could not go away before I had seen him. I went down but he was not there; but Mr. Richards and Mr. Ellison were there at breakfast, who sung a hymn whose first line is, "O thou who when I did complain," at which time I was in some measure supported under my heavy burden.</p>
