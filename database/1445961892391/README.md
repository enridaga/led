<p>Imagine it. At the age of forth-something I finally get to see one of my all-time musical heroines live! Nancy Sinatra has finally come to London and is performing at the Royal Festival Hall. I've booked a dozen tickets and dragged along a group of sympathetic friends to fill them. I'm&nbsp; in the front row and Nancy comes down into the audience to sing one of my faves - Sugar Town. As she reaches the chorus she thrusts her microphone under my nose and I get to duet with Nancy Sinatra in front of EVERYONE!</p>
