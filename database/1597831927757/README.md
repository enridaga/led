### comment


The aim of the ‘On Spital Fields’ project was to devise, rehearse and perform a community cantata involving older people, adults and children from Tower Hamlets and a team of professional musicians and animateurs. The twelve pieces comprising the cantata tell the story of Spitalfields, based on fictional texts and historical documents relating to East End London. Makers included composer Jonathan Dove, librettist Alasdair Middleton, Gerry Cornelius conductor and Clare Whistler, director. Pupils from Osmani and St Anne’s primary schools and Mulberry School for Girls formed the children’s choirs (pupils from additional local schools participated in workshops to develop the project). Also performing were the Wessex Singers (Tower Hamlet’s choir for the over 50’s), The Joyful Company of Singers, an SATB choir and a community chorus, students from the Royal Academy of Music and Chroma Ensemble. The Society of Royal Cumberland Youths rang the bells of Christ Church, Spitalfields, its completed restoration celebrated by ‘On Spital Fields’, before both evening performances on 22 and 23 June 2005. 

Dove’s score is dedicated to Christopher Robert Vaughan (1961-1999), a passionate supporter of Spitalfields Festival. Vaughan left a legacy that helped to fund ‘On Spital Fields’. The community cantata was intended to celebrate Vaughan’s life.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: Cambria, serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">What a triumph! Judy and I were on a real high when we came out of the church. What an evening! It was exactly right and to see amateurs and professionals working alongside children in such a slick performance was magic to see! Those kids will never forget a night like that. It can only have done even more to cement Spitalfields as the leading community Festival in London. Please pass on our heartfelt thanks and congratulation, especially to Jonathan [Dove], but also to everyone involved in what was such a wonderful experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
