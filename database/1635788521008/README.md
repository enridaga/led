<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">This event aimed to build on [Brenda Rattray&rsquo;s] successful work as Tower Hamlet&rsquo;s Choral Animateur by providing an opportunity for her to work with [pianist] Ken Burton and members of the London Adventist Chorale (performing in Concerts by Candlelight). Schools which had recently worked with Brenda were invited to join together to recap and learn some new songs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Brenda and Ken conveyed an amazing enthusiasm throughout the 2 hours, drawing the [114] pupils together and almost immediately eliminating the distinction between 2 groups of children from 2 different schools [Cyril Jackson School and Halley School]. The children sang some songs they had learnt with Brenda and she and Ken taught some new material. Most memorable was Brenda&rsquo;s improvisation: singing to the children and asking them how they were feeling, in every case encouraging individual children to sing back. Both artists found it a very rewarding experience and commented that they learnt a huge amount from each other.&nbsp;</span></p>

### comment


The Spitalfields Festival has been, since 1976, a major professional music event in the East End of London. Listening experiences relate to the Festival’s Education and Community Programme (ECP), launched in 1989. Education projects with schools and local community reflect these groups’ concepts and practices of the arts. The ECP is collaborative, linking musicians, writers and visual artists and the Spitalfields Festival with East End of London children, adults and elderly people.
