"The first note that he played on his Guarnerius," writes M. SCHILLING in the Lexique Universel de Musique, "indeed, from his first step into the room, his reputation was decided in Germany. Acted upon, as by an electric spark, a brilliant halo of glory appeared to invest his whole person, he stood before us like a miraculous apparition in the domain of Art!" He gave concerts in the capital of Austria on the 13th, I6th, and 18th of April 1828. The greatest players and musicians from all parts flocked to hear him. MAYSEDER, JANSA, SLAWICH, STREBINGER, BOHAI, united in extolling the new prodigy. In a very few days Vienna seemed to be turned upside down no class of people was unmoved by the presence of this extraordinary man. The newspapers were full of verses and articles on PAGANINI. Cravats, coats, gloves, hats, shoes, and even cigar-cases and snuff-boxes everything was now a la Paganini. The fashionable cooks called new dishes by his name; any great stroke at billiards was a coup a la Paganini.</span></p>
