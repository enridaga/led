<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">One of the highlights of our year&mdash;our school concert [&hellip;] [A]fter much heart searching the day at last came when the children were given their parts. Who could sing, who could recite, who could dance, most of all, who could memorise and who were capable of being stage managers[&hellip;]</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Well the cantata, poems, dances, sketches decided, we were then given our parts, and as there was usually only one book we all had to take turns in borrowing it and copying out the different acts. The music was drawn on the blackboard&nbsp;and the songs we learnt by repetition; the first days of practice were bedlam [&hellip;] The teacher was nearly out of her mind for the time being, and having finished with us through the day would ask as many as could return to school&nbsp;at night<strong>&nbsp;</strong>for extra practice. This to us was marvellous, there was something wonderful about the night so long as we had plenty of companions [&hellip;]&nbsp;&nbsp;and as we walked arm in arm through the plantation we sang songs that we were to sing on the Big Night, and the carols which we were learning in preparation for Christmas.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">[the school concert is held in the Church Hall]</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Cambria;">[A]t last the stage curtains were drawn aside, the lamps were turned up, the applause had died down and the children sang an opening song of welcome [&hellip;][Then] the music struck up, the curtains parted once more [...] and the concert was now really in full swing.&nbsp; There was clapping from the front, whistling from the 'sixpennys' and those who were standing and did not have to pay [...] it was a happy throng, we sang, acted, danced and bowed with eyes on our parents to make sure they approved. [&hellip;] we all wanted the concert ot go off well, and it usually did.&nbsp; Finally a vote of thanks from the Rector followed by one from a School Manager who nearly always said the same thing,&nbsp;the piano sounded the chord for God Save the King<strong>&nbsp;</strong>to which we all stood with absolute silence and sincerity. And then home to bed.</span></p>
