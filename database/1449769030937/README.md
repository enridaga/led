<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I'll always treasure the sight of Otto Klemperer painfully and slowly making his way up to the rostrum, collapsing exhaustedly on to his stool, then suddenly springing into life, seeming twenty years younger as he brought the Philharmonia into the opening bars of whichever Beethoven symphony it was to be that evening. Unforgettable!</p>
