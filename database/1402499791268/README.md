### has_evidence_text


On October 24 I am warned to proceed with a draft for Gallipoli at 9.00 am on 25th.... At 6.00 pm on 24 October it was raining like hell. However, rain will not deter me from having what may be the last night in old England. Horace B., who I will refer to as 'Horatius' asked me where I was going.
     I replied, 'I am going out to get as drunk as Croesus or John the Baptist.' I did not care which. 
     'Half a mo, old chappie, and I willl accompany you,' he said...
     At 8.20 pm, I suggested to ‘Horatius’ that we should return to camp and look up number sixteen hut, as a Quaker or Methodist or Shinto society, through patriotic motives, were giving a farewell ‘do’ in the form of a concert to the ‘dear lads’ before they went out to be killed. He fell in with my suggestion and we arrived in time to see an adorable ‘piece of fluff' dressed in a Stuart tartan with Tam-o-Shanter to match. She was singing - ‘Yes! We all love you, but we think you ought to go’ - a straight tip, a gentle tip, falling from the lips of one so adorable. So ‘Horatius’ and I went straight to our barrack room.
