<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">In 1951 I was 13 years of age in the May and attending Drury Falls Secondary School, Hornchurch, Essex, I also belonged to the Choir. Our school choir was among the various choirs that sang for the opening of&nbsp; the Festival Hall. I still have the badge. The thing I remember most was all the glass, we had never seen so much glass, in fact one of the members of our choir walked into a door, because at that time no one had thought to put dots or markers on them to make them more visible. Attending the 50th Anniversary Concert brought back all the memories. My husband is a member 279094.&nbsp;</p>
