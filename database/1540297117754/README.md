<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">A few things attracted me while living at Claro Place. A &ldquo;German band&rdquo; now and again used to play in the streets. The band consisted of about half a dozen players with various&nbsp;wind instruments. It was said they were actual Germans, who for some reason or another had come over to England to find work. I remember also a man with a black dancing bear attached to a chain, he had&nbsp;a wind instrument, and somehow managed to get his bear on its two hind feet to do a so-called dance. It was great fun for us. His object of course was to collect coppers for the performance &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think, in these modern days this would be allowed. The old &ldquo;Hurdy-Gurdies&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tinglearies&rdquo; (as we always called them) were very often in the streets. These were a type of piano on a two-wheel cart. The man in charge would twine the handle attached to his instrument and out would roll the tunes,- chiefly popular song tunes of the day that every boy was whistling. These &ldquo;Tinglearies&rdquo; were very popular and many people, including shop-keepers engaged the &ldquo;Tingleary Man&rdquo; to call on them when they were in the district.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Occasionally a &ldquo;Tingleary Man&rdquo; had a monkey on the top of his instrument as an extra attraction. -- it was said that some of these men made a &ldquo;good thing&rdquo; out of it. To change the tunes of these instruments, a new punched roll or ribbon had to be inserted.- the same&nbsp;principle I think as on a &ldquo;Pianola&rdquo;. The mill girls used to dance in the open air to the Tingleary. Sad to say, the Tingleary (like the railway steam engine) is now a thing of the past- or a &ldquo;Museum Piece&rdquo;.&nbsp;</span></p>
