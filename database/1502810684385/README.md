## excerpt from 'Letter from Elizabeth Sais to Charles Wesley, May 1742' (227 words)

### value


<p>One night my husband and I were coming to the Room where I expected to hear you, but one told us that Mr. Cen[ni]ck was to be there, at which I was so displeased that I would have returned and attempted to go back three or four times had not my husband used his utmost persuasion that I might not. But as soon as I came to the Room, I was for going out; but I found at Mr. Cen[ni]ck's giving out a hymn that I was taking the enemy's part against my own soul for when the hymn was sung, those four lines of another hymn came to my mind which are written below, and the Lord spoke those words to my soul and applied them to my heart; so that, to the great comfort of my soul, I could once more declare that the God of tender mercy had healed my backsliding and written pardon in my heart as with a pen of iron. I could wish to die that instant, because I was not at all afraid to meet the king of terror.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I know thou will accept me now,<br />I know my sins are now forgiven.<br />My head to death O let me bow,<br />Nor keep my life, to lose my heaven."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus I went on my way rejoicing.</p>
