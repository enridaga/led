Mr. Ludlam, like many other mathematicians, had a great love for music, without even a tolerable ear. When the new peel of bells for St. Martin's
were casting by Arnold, the bell-founder, I often accompanied Mr. Ludlam to assist in tuning them. Arnold was an ingenious mechanic; but as he had not a correct judgment in sounds, he was obliged to have recourse to musical people in tuning his bells. This being the case, a committee was formed to whom the bells were submitted before they were hung up. This was a source of great plague to poor Arnold; for of the numerous opinions advanced, scarcely two were alike. It was concluded, however, after much consultation, that the treble bell was too sharp, and a man was set to work with a pick-axe, to chip the inside of the bellâ€™s mouth, to flatten it, which produced such an incessant yelling that the whole town was annoyed for three days, after which the bell was found to be more out of tune than before. A second council was called, and it was ordered to be skirted to raise it again, which is effected by chipping off the outward rim. It was so tortured, however, in this way, that it was ultimately spoilt, and returned into the furnace to be recast. In a second tuning, Arnold took care not to call together his committee of long ears, and I was the only person consulted.
