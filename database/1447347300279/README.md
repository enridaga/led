### value


<p>We came to the Festival hall from the time it opened. We did not have much money in those days and could afford only the cheapest seats behind the Orchestra which had the advantage of watching the Conductors and some of their antics. The highlight was the visit of the Vienna State Opera for which we scraped the money together, and these performances were quite unforgettable.</p>
