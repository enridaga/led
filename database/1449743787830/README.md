<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I&rsquo;m not sure this constitutes a great story but &hellip;.My father took me to The Royal Festival Hall for the first time in August 1963 when I was 11. &nbsp; I can&rsquo;t remember the actual date but I still have the programme, which was for the London Festival Ballet performing Coppelia, with Jeanette Minty and George Goviloff in the main roles - I don&rsquo;t think they ever became household names, but I loved it all the same.&nbsp; Recent highlights have to be seeing heroes from the past such as David Bowie at Meltdown, Ray Davies and the Brian Wilson Smile concert. Scariest moment?&nbsp; Taking Lemmy from Production onto the RFH roof for his photo shoot for the &lsquo;pick a poem project&rsquo; in 2003 for the Poetry Library&rsquo;s 50th birthday - the parapet walls seemed very low!
