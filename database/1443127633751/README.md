<p>&nbsp;Then one day a gaunt young man with long hair and a nervous cough came to tune the piano... &nbsp;</p>
<p>Jack and I were vastly&nbsp;interested. &nbsp;We stood side by side watching him that Saturday morning&hellip;</p>
<p>During a pause, after the tuning was done, [Jack] produced the Beethoven sonata, and asked the tuner to give him an inkling how it should be attacked.</p>
<p>The result was like that of opening a weir. &nbsp;The thin, bow-backed figure of the piano-tuner shook with latent energy. &nbsp;He tossed his hair back, cracked his bony knuckles, and began to play the sonata in G major, Opus 31, No. 1 (published in 1803), which &hellip; opens with a startling statement, a running gesture, and then the assertion of a theme whose dogma is beyond all doubt.</p>
<p>The tuner emphasised that dogma with the vehemence of a Savonarola castigating the pleasure-loving Florentines. &nbsp;Jack and I swayed like water-weeds in the flood, making the same mesmeric movements under the invisible punches of the music. &nbsp;Then, after the violent assertion and running to and fro, the second part of the sonata, heard by us both for the first time in our lives, came out with a long, rapid melody that tore us up by the roots and flung us downstream; the mainstream of the art of music.</p>
<p>The musician was equally touched by his own magic, for as he played this melody, he leaned over it, watering it with his flowing hair, which almost touched the ivories. &nbsp;I was deeply impressed, as much by the spectacle as by the music. &nbsp;All was new to me: the performer, his odd manners and appearance, the nature of the music and the fluidity of the performance. That is why I have never forgotten that half-hour &hellip;</p>
<p>When the performance ended, the pianist sat, nervously working the muscles of his cadaverous face &hellip; Then he turned to Jack, and looked at him. &nbsp;But Jack was lost. &nbsp;He stood before the keyboard, staring at the notes&hellip; suddenly he looked up, quietly thanked the tuner, and left the room. &nbsp;He must, however, have gone to Mother and spoken to her, for when she appeared, without Jack, to pay the tuner, she asked him if he would give the boy some lessons, a request to which he agreed.</p>
