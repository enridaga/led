We went ... to a place near Arras to have a rest. We were fed on double rations - as were the horses - to strengthen us as summer was coming. It was rather nice, and although we were quite a distance away from Messines, when I was on picket duty I heard the terrific roar of the mines going off. Eventually we heard we were going to go to Passchendaele. The 51st Division had just come out and I used to hear their bagpipes in the morning. I remember their buttons were polished, and they were always marching up and down, and above our heads the Richthofen circuses would have their dogfights going on at various times.
