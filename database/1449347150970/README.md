<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">It was a Chris Barber jazz concert, I think, 1954, although I can't now be sure.&nbsp; I was there with my girlfriend and we had booked tickets in advance.&nbsp; When we got there, there was some mix-up over the seating and we had nowhere to sit.&nbsp; (Several of us were in the same boat).&nbsp; Finally, someone brought out some spare seats from behind the stage and arranged them in a semi circle on the stage to either side of the band.&nbsp; We spent the concert sitting on the stage right next to the band.&nbsp; Fantastic!&nbsp; I always listen especially closely to the Chris Barber Royal Festival Hall recordings from the 50's to see if I can hear myself shouting and applauding! &nbsp;</p>
