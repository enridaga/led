### comment


The memoirs of Katherine Henderson (pseudonym of Katherine Dudley) span the early 20th c. to 1974 when the author retired from domestic service, aged 66. The Burnett Archive of Working Class Autobiographies was gathered together by John Burnett, David Vincent and Davide Mayall whilst compiling their three-volume annotated bibliography "The Autobiography of the Working Class" (Harvester Press 1984-1989).

This was a wish fulfilled, as I had heard of his wonderful preaching and longed to hear him myself. The City Temple, his Church, had been badly damaged during the war [&hellip;] The queue outside the City Temple on a Sunday had to be seen to be believed, they started queueing up a good hour before the services were due to start, morning and evening services alike. Buses emptied their precious cargo there, and once the doors opened, we flocked inside, and every seat would be occupied a good half-hour before the service commenced [&hellip;]&nbsp;It was a fantastic experience, a full choir in their beautiful blue robes, and mortar boards for the ladies, and a wonderful organist. The Church itself was beautiful inside, with its wedgewood blue walls and woodwork of the Cedars of Lebanon; the massive organ which sometimes made the air vibrate, and the unusual pulpit which seemed to cling to the sides of the Church, no support being visible [&hellip;] To go to the City Temple on a Sunday was the High light of my whole week; I could not get there quickly enough and was loath to leave at the end of the service.&nbsp;</p>
