This was by no means the case; she gave universal satisfaction [&hellip;] </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 12.55pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; margin: 0cm 56.0pt .0001pt 0cm;"><span style="mso-bidi-language: EN-GB;">The next place must be given to Miss Stephens, [&hellip;] It would be flattery to say she sung as well as she formerly did, the change in her voice made that impossible, as it has lost in extent as well as power; but when she performed songs of moderate compass, and easy ex&shy;ecution, she was still very agreeable, and left little to be desired. When obliged, as she injudiciously was, to attempt others of a higher description, she certainly failed, and could not give them with sufficient force.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 12.55pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; margin: 0cm 56.0pt .0001pt 0cm;"><span style="mso-bidi-language: EN-GB;">The third in order was Madame Stockhausen, a very good singer and musician, but hardly strong enough for the higher styles of music. She has gained great favour here, by the exquisite taste and expression with which she sings national Swiss airs, than which (as I am told) nothing can be more delightful. Her skill and science enable her, however, to sing always well.</span></p>
