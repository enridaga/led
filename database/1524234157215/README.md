Those were pleasant evenings. &ldquo;Oh Memory&rdquo; was about my greatest favourite in singing. At these gatherings besides receiving our fees, we had a very good supper, &amp; coupons for two glasses of grog afterwards. I also sang at Several Concerts in the neighbourhood, at a private one at Lord Wilton&rsquo;s residence &amp; at one at Ashton Under Lyne, the principals being Mrs Sunderland, a famous oratorio singer, known as the Yorkshire Nightingale, Miss Palmer Contralto, myself tenor, &amp; Mr Henri Wharton Bass.
