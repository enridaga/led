<p>Fond memories of Children's Concerts with my sisters giving a life long love of music and as we got older and started work our parents would chose concerts from that big sheet which came regularly, and we would pay for them to go. A treat they loved and appreciated (we had parties while they were out!) We also regularly went to the Ballet when it was on and I took my own children in the '90s. Grandchildren next soon!</p>
