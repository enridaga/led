<p>The first time ever I visited the Royal Festival Hall was in July 2003 when a friend and me attended a great concert of Sweet Honey in the Rock. We flew all the way from Austria just to see them perform and it was breathtaking!!!!!&nbsp; What they can do with only their voices is unbelievable. This will remain one of the most special moments in my life .....</p>
