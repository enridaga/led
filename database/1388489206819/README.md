### comment


The listening experience took place in a car on a journey from Lenox MA to New York City.  Leonard Marcus, a Harvard music graduate (like Bernstein), was appointed editor-in-chief of High Fidelity and Musical America, a post he held from 1968 to 1980.  He later worked at Columbia Records and as editor of Carnegia Hall’s programmes.

Dear Lenny
Merely a line to tell you that 1) you nearly caused me to have an accident and 2) I heard a performance of Mahler Second that was more overwhelming that anything I remembered even you ever having done -  and that goes back to my unforgettable first encounter with the work, singing it as a teenager under you at Tanglewood.
Earlier today I drove down to NYC from Lenox.  When I got close enough to catch a City station worth fielding, the radio was in the middle of the Mahler.  Almost immediately, even with the lo fi of the car radio, I realized I was surrounded by an extraordinary performance.  By the middle of the last movement, I concluded that a new champion of the work had succeeded in snatching  from you the belt reading “Most in Tune with Mahler’s Soul.”
I anticipated the penultimate choral chord – and what genius did it take to bring this epic to its perfect climax simply by expanding a dominant from closed to open position? – but what I heard so overpowered my expectations that I did something I haven’t done in a couple of years.
I cried.
It only lasted a moment, but in that moment, I nearly swerved into another  car as we came to the 59th Street exit of the West Side Highway.
You needn’t worry.  By 42nd Street I had already forgiven you.  During the interim, Marty Bookspan had announced which Philharmonic concert had just been rebroadcast.
Does anyone realize how great music dangerous can be?  I mean, Plato’s dead and all that, but even he could only have had a more formal, Dionysian version of Rock in mind, and everybody knows how to complain about that.  No, I’m referring to the perils of the classics.  I hope Surgeon General Koop doesn’t find out.  As always with love, Lenny.
