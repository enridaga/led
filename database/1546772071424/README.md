### comment


Kevin Crossley-Holland quotes an entire letter that he wrote to his family when he was 12 years old and boarding at Swanbourne School.  The ‘carols’ is likely to refer to 'Six Carols for Sundry Seasons' composed by his father, Peter Crossley-Holland, which was broadcast twice during 1953: on Sunday 11 January at 18.00 and on Wednesday 8 April at 23.35.  Also a concert including unspecified ‘new choral music', conducted by Peter Crossley-Holland and John Lowe on Friday 3 July at 22.00. Given that Kevin specifically refers to 'Friday night' in his letter, the final option seems most likely.  Source: BBC Genome Project Radio Times listings.
