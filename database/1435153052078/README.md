<p>When I came into New York I was asking Louis [Armstrong] one night about the different guys in the Fletcher Henderson band. He told me about Big Charlie Green and about a tenor saxophone player--Hawkins--he said that guy really swings. That was the first time I heard the word used that way, and I didn't dig what he meant. Louis tried to explain it. He said, "Man, he swings! He swings out of this world!". I caught on to what he meant, because after I got to work that night I heard Hawkins. So I knew what he meant. How would I define it now? Swing. A guy that's&hellip; I still have to use the word swing. I mean a guy who's got a beat--a certain accent--a certain attack. Part of it is that you are playing along with the beat.</p>
