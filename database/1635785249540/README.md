# Listening Experience 1635785249540

### comment


Weavers’ Field Special School supported children with emotional and behavioural difficulties, all of whom live with conditions or circumstances that result in low self-esteem, lack of confidence and difficulty working as a group. The schoolboys featured in the listening experience were 9 – 11 years old and participated in five music and composition sessions between 20 June and 18 July.

### comment


The Spitalfields Festival has been, since 1976, a major professional music event in the East End of London. Listening experiences relate to the Festival’s Education and Community Programme (ECP), launched in 1989. Education projects with schools and local community reflect these groups’ concepts and practices of the arts. The ECP is collaborative, linking musicians, writers and visual artists and the Spitalfields Festival with East End of London children, adults and elderly people.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">It has been very good to see and hear how [the children] have responded to [visiting artists Simon Foxley and Julie Spencer] and how they have discovered new ways of creatively expressing feelings. None of them had previously&nbsp;played a cello&nbsp;and I was delighted that several of the children were able to perform their compositions in front of an audience. I don&rsquo;t know whether you realised what an achievement this was for them&mdash;to take the risk of doing this when they would have been very nervous and might have forgotten what they were going to do was a big step forward.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The fact that they had composed&nbsp;two group songs&nbsp;was also an achievement for children who are generally very self-centred owing to their problems and delayed emotional development.&nbsp;</span></p>
