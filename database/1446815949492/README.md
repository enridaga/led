<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Helvetica;">I have all sorts of memories of the Festival Hall, all music, from seeing Miles Davies turn his back on the audience and people in suits walk out of the best show ah've seen him do and em to&nbsp; . the&nbsp; . older gentlemen from the [Samurai] orchestra playing with the em now much older eh guys from the [MC5] and then having a drink with them having sneaked through the eh security after the show. Both fantastic shows. What an amazing place</p>
