<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;I became interested in [a small Methodist chapel] in my early teens. It was about a mile from my home, and I first attended the Sunday School [and] became a member of a Bible Class there, and had at least three teachers. One was a cultured man who was church organist also, very fond of music and earned his livelihood by doing clerical work for a coal factor a few miles away [&hellip;] My interest in meetings at the chapel increased, and I became detached a little from other lads [who worked in the coal mine], attending the Women&rsquo;s meeting during the week, and was most interested in what they said. I went to a Class Meeting that was held before the morning Service, and accompanied one of the men to his home to wait until the morning Service. I was very interested in two of them who were neighbours, and were kind and helpful to me. The son of one learned to play the piano, and liked to practice a little on Sunday mornings, and one morning when I was in the dining room he was playing in the parlour as usual when his mother called out, &lsquo;Harry, not that today&rsquo;. It was nice music to my ear, but not so to his mother, for it suggested dance music that was not permitted on Sundays. Harry did not make a fuss about it, but being an obedient son, changed the tune for another.&nbsp;</span></p>

### comment


George Gregoryâ€™s (born 1888) illustrated memoir contains extensive information about his childhood, early adulthood and experiences of mine working. About half of the document discusses political and social ideas that were of great interest to the author. The unpublished memoir is held in The Burnett Archive of Working Class Autobiographies, gathered together by John Burnett, David Vincent and David Mayall whilst compiling their three-volume annotated bibliography, "The Autobiography of the Working Class" (Harvester Press, 1984-1989).
