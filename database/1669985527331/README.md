### value


<p>[W]hen, in 1847, it was demonstrated to them [the Governors of the Foundling Hospital]... that the establishment of a <em>Juvenile Band</em> of musicians, from amongst the boys, would be attended with advantages to them in life, they did not hesitate readily to adopt the suggestion. The proposal was immediately put into practice, and the results are highly satisfactory, proving (if indeed proof were necessary) that the cultivation of instrumental music amongst the children of the Hospital <em>is not attended</em> with that <em>degradation of moral character</em> so much apprehended in Dr. Burney's time. For not only has the general moral character of those instructed in music been <em>improved</em>, and their physical capacities enlarged, by the influence of music during their stay at the Hospital; but... considerable social advantages have been derived by many of them from this source when they have quitted the establishment...</p>
<p>It is now some years since the band was formed, numbering about thirty boys from nine to fourteen years. This number has, ever since, been maintained, sometimes exceeded. The boys are selected from amongst those who possess a musical ear, due regard being paid to their physical development. As the musical instruments, to which they are placed, are essentially <em>men's</em> instruments, considerable physical exertion is required in playing upon them. Great care is, therefore bestowed in watching the effects this early application produces upon the health of the children; and no instance has ever occurred of injury being done by blowing. On the contrary, boys of delicate constitution have greatly improved in health from the exercise of a wind instrument.</p>
<p>As a considerable portion of the time allotted to the practice of music is drawn from the ordinary school hours, great care has, also, been taken to ascertain how far the band-boys are - when brought into competition at the annual school examination with other boys not in the band - affected by this arrangement, and the results have shown that a full proportion of the prizes, awarded for scholastic pursuits has been constanty carried off by band-boys. This success at school may fairly be attributed to the salutary effects of music upon the character of those boys receiving instruction in the art, which imparts vivacity to their tempers, and by its enlightening influence, renders the mental capacities more energetic and susceptible of receiving general instruction, than the faculties of the other boys attain, who do not enjoy the advantage of musical tuition.</p>
<p>During the period the band has been formed, a large number of the boys have received instruction, of whom, many, at their own desire, have been placed as musicians in the bands of Her Majesty's Household Troops, and other regiments, and also in the Royal Navy. Thus, while securing an eligible position in life for the boys, has the formation of the band proved, by saving the expenses of premium and outfit allowed for each boy ordinarily apprenticed, "of considerable advatage to <em>this corporation, and of national utility</em>." Nor should it be lost sight of, that very many of the boys who have passed through the band, and are now occupied in various trades to which they have been apprenticed, have followed up their music as a recreation with satisfaction to themselves, and to those with whom it is their lot to be placed.</p>
