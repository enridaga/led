<p>Was taken to the Festival Hall by my elder sister to see the Bolshoi do Pas de Deux and was absolutely amazed when the mail [sic] dancer caught the female and he was standing almost in the orchestra pit and I just exploded with cheers until everyone joined in as it was a matinee and the audience was so cold up until then. My sister was very embarrassed but I was so excited. The next time I remember the Festival Hall was when dear Joan Sutherland was singing their [sic] and I had a seat two rows in front of her and she was laughing at me while she was singing, because I was sliding down the seat. She has a gorgeous voice and it is so powerful. She said to me afterwards like You won't do that again.</p>
