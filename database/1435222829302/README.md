<p>My! Some of those rehearsals were a pleasure to watch. They would have some real battles. "Cuttin' contests", you know. I would set off in a dark corner and watch while Charlie Green (we called him Big Green) would be playing something wonderful [on trombone] and then Jimmy Harrison would say, "Huh, you think <em>you</em>&nbsp;done somethin'," and then he'd try to cut him. It was that way with the whole band [Fletcher Henderson's band]. I'm telling you, it was just thrilling!</p>
