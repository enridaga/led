<p class="MsoNormal">I was again to night alla casa Grimani [&hellip;] I am ashamed to say that this concert, I was told was designed as a regale for me in particular. The band was numerous &ndash; Signor Sacchini at the harpsichord and to sing, there was an abate who sung in the most exquisite taste: and with great difficulty Signora Regina Zocchi had been prevailed on to come [&hellip;] She has a powerful voice and sings charmingly with great execution in allegros and execution in slow movements. But now comes the most curious part of the tale. I was obliged by general solicitation to sit down at the harpsichord (I had not seen one since Madame Brillon&rsquo;s). I would just as readily have submitted to the discipline of the salt canals of Venice, as this ceremony &ndash; but there was no retreat. I played a voluntary, for I could neither see or remember anything I was so frightened. However the politeness of the company extended to general applause and compliments without end from the professors. I then presented her excellence Signora Bassa with a movement of my own which I had transcribed with design to play it first &ndash; but durst not. Her excellence received it very graciously and seemed even much obliged by it.</p>
