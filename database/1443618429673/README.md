<p>As part of the Festival of Britain Celebration and event called the 'Festival of Jazz' was held. My father, Dave Carey, was at the forefront of the British Traditional Jazz at the time and his group, the 'Dave Carey Jazz Band' was selected to play. My mother, twin brother and I had VIP seats in the auditorium and there we listened to all the greats of UK Jazz: Humphrey Lyttleton, Sandy Brown, Chris Barber, Terry Lightfoot etc. etc. I can well remember the fantastic atmosphere in the packed hall, but most of all the new cool modern design, so different from the average stuffy Victorian/Edwardian concert venues.</p>
