<p>Mademoiselle Piccolomini was brought out by Lumley at Her Majesty's Theatre in 1856. She was the first to sing the leading role in Verdi's <em>La Traviata</em>. She was a little woman, but rather handsome, with fine, even features. It used to be said that she would never succeed in being able to shake, although she worked very hard at this accom- plishment, and in this particular opera it was so necessary to sing a shake, the arias being full of trills as well as runs, chromatic scales, and brilliant bravura passages. However, she got through all these difficulties with much credit to herself. I remember well a certain evening on which she sang <em>La Traviata</em>, because Mr. Charles Braham, son of the celebrated John Braham, took the part of Alfredo in that opera, which he had studied with me, and had previously studied in Italy, and it was his first appearance at the opera here. Naturally he felt very nervous, and so was his sister Frances, Countess of Waldegrave, who had previously asked me to remain with her on that memorable occasion at her house in Carlton Gardens until after the performance was over. The result was most favourable to Mr. Braham, and Lady Waldegrave was overjoyed, and presented Mademoiselle Piccolomini with a very handsome piece of jewellery as a mark of her gratitude for singing with her brother.</p>
