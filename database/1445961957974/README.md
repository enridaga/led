### value


<p>Morrissey returns! Shout it loud and proud in bright red lights. I remember with excitement and selfish indulgence seeing Morrissey perform as part of the Meltdown season. Always loved by his audience, the venue paid equal respect with its sense of place and occasion. A perfect combination! Getting up early, queueing in the rain to get tickets, and sneaking into work late - SO worth it!</p>
