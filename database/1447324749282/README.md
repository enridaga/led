<p>The Robert Mayer Concerts which took place on a Saturday morning were instrumental in imbuing me with a lasting love of a wide range of Classical Music. The orchestras were excellent and the explanatory notes in the programmes and sometimes directly from the conductor shed light on the music, making it accessible and exciting. Shame there is no modern equivalent!</p>
