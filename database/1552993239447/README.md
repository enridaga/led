### comment


Henry Croswell (1840–93) kept a record of his visits to churches in London over a period of more than twelve years (1872–85).  He made methodical notes about the number of clergy, the churchmanship, the congregation, the sermon and the church architecture, as well as commenting on the music that he heard (the organ, the hymns and the choir).  The above listening experience has been extracted from one of these records.
Richard Robert Chope (1830–1928) was the first vicar of St Augustine’s, South Kensington, a church that was built by special request of his parishioners to accommodate his preferred Anglo-Catholic form of liturgy.  Chope took a lively interest in church music, compiling a new hymnal in 1857, and, whilst at St Augustine’s, ‘Carols for Use in Church: During Christmas and Epiphany’ (1875), with Herbert S. Irons as musical editor, and containing an introductory essay by Sabine Baring Gould championing the use of carols as a popular vehicle for the teaching of Christian doctrine.

### comment


It is not known who transcribed Croswell’s diaries, or when.  The British Library record was created in 1960.  The pages are unnumbered, but most records are individually numbered.  Record numbers have therefore been used in place of page numbers, where available.  A further transcript of the diaries is held at the Bodleian Library.
