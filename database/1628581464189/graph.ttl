        rdfs:comment         "Prior to the establishment of the Panama Canal, Cruces was a staging post for travellers drawn to the California Gold Rush. Seacole stayed at Cruces for two years, noting in her memoir, ‘‘Four crowds generally passed through Cruces every month. In these were to be found passengers to and from Chili [sic], Peru, and Lima, as well as California and America. […]  The great majority of the travellers were rough, rude men, of dirty, quarrelsome habits; the others were more civilized and more dangerous. And it was not long before I grew very tired of life in Cruces, although I made money rapidly, and pressed my brother to return to Kingston. Poor fellow! […] He stayed only to find a grave on the Isthmus of Panama (p. 37)’. "@en;

        rdfs:comment                "Mary Jane Seacole (nee Grant, 1805 – 1881), the daughter of a Jamaican woman and a Scottish soldier, was an intrepid traveller, businesswoman, a pioneering nurse/healer and heroine of the Crimean War, known throughout the region as Mother Seacole. When the War Office refused her request to nurse soldiers in the Crimea, she travelled independently, establishing the British Hotel near Balaclava to provide shelter, food and convalescence. She risked her life to nurse the wounded on battlefields. She was supported and celebrated on her return to London after the war, ill and destitute, including a fund-raising festival (1857) attracting thousands of people. Her portrait (1869) is displayed at the National Portrait Gallery London. Her legacy--neglected for over a century—has been recovered. She was posthumously awarded the Jamaican Order of Merit in 1991, and a statue of Seacole was erected in 2016 in the grounds of St Thomas’ Hospital, London, among other honours.  "@en;

Gambling was a great attraction; but my brother, dreading its consequences with these hot-brained armed men, allowed none to take place in his hotel. So some lounged away to the faro and monte tables, which were doing a busy trade; others loitered in the verandah, smoking, and looking at the native women, who sang and danced fandangos before them. The whole of the dirty, woe-begone place, which had looked so wretched by the light of day, was brilliantly illuminated now. Night would bring no rest to Cruces, while the crowds were there to be fed, cheated, or amused. Daybreak would find the faro-tables, with their piles of silver and little heaps of gold-dust, still surrounded by haggard gamblers; daybreak would gleam sickly upon the tawdry finery of the poor Spanish singers and dancers, whose weary night&rsquo;s work would enable them to live upon the travellers&rsquo; bounty for the next week or so.&nbsp;</span></p>"^^rdf:HTML;
