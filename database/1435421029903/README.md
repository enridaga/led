<p>One day I was going to Dave's Cafe on the corner of 50th Street and Garfield Boulevard in Chicago for a drink and to say hello to some friends when Fats Waller recognised me [and invited me to a party]&hellip; After work, I went to Fats' hotel&hellip; He took me by the hand and presented me to his guests. There were fifteen. Then to my great astonishment I saw that Fats had installed right in the middle of the room a Hammond organ, and as I showed my surprise Fats answered, "Lyon and Healy gave it to me." (That was a large musical instrument store in Chicago). "Sit down and put yourself at ease." And then, without waiting any longer, he began to play on the organ, and how he played! Fats played all that you can imagine. I knew what a great organist he was from having heard him at the Regal Theatre, but I never heard him play as well as he did in his hotel room that night. After three hours of concentrated music by Fats and although it was already nine in the morning, no one showed any sign of fatigue. "Have another glass and I'll play you my favorite piece." I knew Fats' entire repertoire, but when he began to play "Abide With Me" I fell back and tears came into my eyes. Who would imagine that that was the favourite song of the great Fats?</p>
