Archdeacon Farrar was also a Canon of the Abbey, while as Rector of the Commons' Church he was always willing to give facilities for musical celebrations at St. Margaret's, in which I was glad to help him in any way, for he was a kind and cordial friend. On one occasion he got me to help with the
boys in a performance of John Farmer's Cantata, "Christ and His Soldiers." He had known Farmer at Harrow, and had a great admiration for him. Farmer came and conducted his work, which, although it cannot be called a great masterpiece, seemed to give him intense pleasure. He got very excited, and
perspired immensely with his exertions. I had the pleasant sensation of having assisted in a very strenuous undertaking.
