<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">(I've been coming to the RFH since the 1980s.)&nbsp; I attended the gig by Crosby and Nash 1 February 2005.&nbsp; It was one of the most amazing nights of my life.&nbsp; It was like 'Woodstock' come to life again.&nbsp; Crosby and Nash sang in perfect harmony and gave us many blasts from the past like 'Teach Your Children' and 'Wooden Ships' and the sound and acoustics in the RFH were brilliant.&nbsp; I was right up in the Gods, but managed to see them quite well.&nbsp; The audience was full of 40+ (many with their grown up kids in tow) and there was a good atmosphere.&nbsp; Thanks RFH for giving us this amazing gig.</p>
