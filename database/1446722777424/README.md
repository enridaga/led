<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 12.4pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; margin: 0cm 23.0pt .0001pt 0cm;">Her [Mrs. Billington&rsquo;s] voice, though sweet and flexible, was not of that full nature which formed the charm of Banti&rsquo;s, but was rather a <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">voce di testa</em>, and in its very high tones resembled a flute or flageolet. Its agility was very great, and every thing she sung was executed in the neatest manner, and with the utmost precision. Her knowledge of music enabled her to give great variety to her embellishments, which, as her taste was good, were always judicious.</p>
