### comment


The listening experiences are responses of retired residents and day visitors at Toynbee Hall about their collaboration with the Green Light Theatre Company to create and perform a piece of music theatre over a two-day period. The end result was not a unified piece of music but a selection of songs written by participants guided by Green Light Theatre Company artists Mary King, Stephen Langridge, Timothy Yealland, Daryl Runswick and poet Jo Shapcott. Few of the participants had experience of vocal, dramatic and writing skills. An evaluation of the project comments that ‘the true value of this work is difficult to quantify but the songs […] speak for themselves. It is quite clear that the experience was memorable and for some participants deeply significant’.

### comment


The Spitalfields Festival has been, since 1976, a major professional music event in the East End of London. Listening experiences relate to the Festival’s Education and Community Programme (ECP), launched in 1989. Education projects with schools and local community reflect these groups’ concepts and practices of the arts. The ECP is collaborative, linking musicians, writers and visual artists and the Spitalfields Festival with East End of London children, adults and elderly people.
