## Spitalfields Festival June 2000: Festival Report

### comment


The Spitalfields Festival has been, since 1976, a major professional music event in the East End of London. Listening experiences relate to the Festival’s Education and Community Programme (ECP), launched in 1989. It devises education projects with schools and community groups that reflect these groups’ concepts and practices of the arts. The ECP is collaborative, linking musicians, writers and visual artists, and the Spitalfields Festival, with East End of London children, adults and elderly people.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">On Tuesday we performed at Spitalfields Christ Church. I played the eggshaker. We worked really hard with Glyn and Simon. The thing I enjoyed was sounds and when we all made statues into a countryside, star, mountain and boat. I like that because we all got a chance to perform, it was really fun working with Glyn and Simon.&nbsp;</span></p>
