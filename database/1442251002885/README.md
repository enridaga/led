### comment


John Evans-Pughe (1925 to 1996) was a chorister (with his younger brother Tom) at the choir of the College of St Nicholas, Chislehurst, under Sir Sydney Nicholson and later a music scholar at Kings School Canterbury, Kent. The St Nicholas choir was recorded for many BBC broadcasts and for Columbia Records. A Columbia recording in 1939 featuring John Evans-Pughe and Michael Lumb as treble soloists singing O Lovely Peace (Handel) and Brother Jamesâ€™ Air (arr. Jacob) was a best seller. 
John did National Service in Egypt and Greece, and then studied science at Trinity College, Dublin. He went on to became an electronics engineer for Marconi Space and Defence Systems, continuing with music in his spare time.

<p>TO: The Rev. J and Mrs. Evans-Pughe, Tovil Vicarage, Maidstone, Kent</p>
<p>FROM: John Evans-Pughe, College of St. Nicholas, Chislehurst, Kent</p>
<p>POSTMARK: 12 Feb 1939</p>
<p>Dear Mummy and Daddy</p>
<p>I have decided that it is not really worth getting a violin case yet, and in any case I would much prefer something else&hellip;I think the only thing that will be of any use to me is a fountain pen, but a cheap one.</p>
<p>We have just been listening to the records of the Broadcast; the silly part about them is that every time we had sung loud the B.B.C. had turned us down a good bit and it would rather spoil the effect.&nbsp; The anthem is the best one.&nbsp; Are you going to buy any of the records when they are ready to be sold?</p>
