<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">Zubin Mehta conducting and Artur Rubenstein playing pieces from Chopin. We were in the choir stalls and could see Zubin's facial expressions and Rubenstein's hands. It was a gala performance but we were in the cheap seats as students and could admire all the well-dressed audience.&nbsp;</p>
