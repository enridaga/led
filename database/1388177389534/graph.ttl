I observd they either not answerd or did it with a great deale of suttlety besides the cover and cunning of that language which others and I beleeve they them selves scarce understand, but I am weary of the Quakers and returne to my freinds with you, to home I desire to be remembred, not thinke when I began that this subject should have soe long kept my pen from them\r\n"@en;
