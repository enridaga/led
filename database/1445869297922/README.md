<p>I was thrilled to have almost centre stage tickets in the front row for the guitar legend David Gilmour's 2002 concerts.&nbsp; I was especially looking forward to seeing his fretwork. Unfortuantely Mr Gilmour had put on a few pounds around hios waist with the passing years, meaning that his guitar was tilted away from me all night.</p>
