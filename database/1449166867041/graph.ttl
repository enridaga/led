        rdf:value   "<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;\">When I was in my final year at school in South Wales, (July 1951), a train was hired to take us all the South Bank. That was the first time I saw the RFH. In September of the same year I was a student at Maria Grey College in Twickenham and I, with some friends, sold programmes on a Saturday morning at the Ernest Read Concerts for Children - which were wonderful. After the audience had settled, we could then sit where we liked and enjoy the concert.I also had musical friends who were involved with Gerard Hoffnung's Concerts - hilarious and marvellous.</p>"^^rdf:HTML;
