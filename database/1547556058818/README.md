British History Online, a digital library created by the Institute of Historical Research and the History of Parliament Trust, includes calendars of state papers in which the listening experience was identified. Calendars are very detailed summaries of documents arranged chronologically, intended as a finding aid. Original documents are often held at the National Archives at Kew.
