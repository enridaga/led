The ‘Eidophusikon’ was a miniature mechanical theatre, measuring ten feet wide, six feet high and eight feet deep, in which realistic, moving natural scenes were created: sunrises, sunsets, moonlight images, storms and volcanoes, along with novel sound and music effects.  It was thought up by the actor David Garrick, and created by the artist Philip James de Loutherberg, who was at the time employed by Garrick as designer at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane.  It was initially presented to the public in Lisle Street, Leicester Square in February 1781.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 115%;">Partial to comedy and farce, and disposed to the <em>vis-comica</em>, I chose for singing and recitation those writings of Peter Pindar, George Colman, jun., George Alexander Stevens, Charles Dibdin, and others, which seemed best calculated to amuse mixed and miscellaneous assemblies of persons, who preferred mirth to melancholy, and smiles to sighs. &nbsp;Hence I was generally greeted with plaudits, and my efforts to please were always cheerfully received.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 115%;">In the winter of 1799, I was engaged by a Mr. Chapman, at three guineas per week, to write, recite and sing for him, at a theatre in Panton Street, Haymarket.&nbsp; That gentleman had assisted De Loutherbourg in preparing and exhibiting his &ldquo;Eidophusikon,&rdquo; which had proved very effective.&nbsp; The scenes and machinery were purchased by Chapman, to combine with other objects for an evening entertainment.
