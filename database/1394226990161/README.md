### has_evidence_text


On entering the pew therefore at the Chapel & the organ being pointed out to me, I was very inquisitive to know when it wo'd be play'd & fix'd my eyes upon it, expecting to see a pair of hands employ'd upon the feet of the gilt pipes in front to produce the sound. What was my astonishment therefore all on a sudden to hear celestial tones issuing of themselves (for aught that appear'd to the contrary) from a most elegant & beautiful instrument, on which my eyes remained fix'd till the voluntary ceas'd. This I co'd no help thinking was extremely short, & was very impatient for it to play again, which at length it did in giving out teh psalm, after which I was very much disconcerted at the mens & boys discordant voices, which drown'd even the full organ, of which however I was gratified with a little between the lines of the the psalm & in the interludes. Of this I afterwards complain'd to my father at home, whom on his asking how I liked the organ I told "very much indeed, but that part of the time the people made such a noice that I could scarce hear it." When the concluding voluntary began I remember I was kneeling upon the seat with my eyes again fix'd on it, rather wond'ring at the peoples coolly walking out whilst it was playing, & co'd not be prevail'd upon myself without some degree of compulsion to quit the pew; to which however I was in some measure reconciled the next time I went by my brother Henry, who observ'd that by going out when the organ was playing I sho'd hear it all the while I went down the stairs, whereas if I staid in the pew 'till it was over I should have to go out without music. I was however still the last to quit the pew & hung back at  the way as much as possible.
