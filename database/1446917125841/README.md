<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">My memory is of a recent concert at the Festival Hall.&nbsp; Brian Wilson's first visit to the Hall in Jan '02.&nbsp; The whole of 'Pet Sounds' and rarely heard classics like 'Surfs Up' and 'Forever' were played to a very reverential audience.&nbsp; A very emotional night for everybody.&nbsp; It was so good I came back again in June to see him in concert!</p>
