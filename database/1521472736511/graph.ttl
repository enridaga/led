        rdf:value   "<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #333333;\">A Correspondent, under the signature of \"A Civilian,\" complains rather angrily, that the public have been lately excluded from the Tower on Sunday evenings, when the band of the regiment stationed there played, almost by \"prescriptive right,\" for the amusement of the neighbourhood. With every respect for our Correspondent, we felt perfectly convinced this step had not been taken without reason, for we know that British regiments are animated by a uniform spirit, leading them, when consistent with their duty, to respect the privileges, and conciliate the good-will of \"Civilians.\" We found, in fact, that the exclusion complained of was rendered compulsory by the very disorderly and improper conduct of the crowd of both sexes, who thronged the Tower during the time the band played on Sunday afternoon ; and that, in the first instance, it was confined to a small space, kept clear for the officers and the inhabitants of the Tower, the female portion of whom, without this precaution, must have remained confined to their houses, so offensive was the conduct of the crowd ; as, however, the sentries were insulted in the execution of their orders, and various disturbances took place, it was thought advisable that the band should discontinue playing on Sundays. It now plays three times a week during the forenoon. These are the facts. We must remind our Correspondent that the band is regimental property, maintained by subscription amongst the officers, and subject solely to the orders of the commanding officer, to play or not as he pleases. A \"Civilian\" has no more \"right\" to their music, than the Coldstream have to insist on his playing the fiddle to <em>them.</em>&mdash;We must also beg to set him right in another particular, in which he has fallen into an error common to the class he professes to represent. In speaking of the army as being a burden to the state, we beg him to reverse the proposition, and he will be nearer the truth. The army and navy of England <em>have </em>nobly supported, <em>do </em>support, and <em>will, </em>with God's blessing, still support the state, which, we shrewdly suspect, <em>without </em>their support, would, in the absence of foreign assailants, fall a prey to its own factions, to the great detriment of \"Civilians\" in general.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #333333;\">With this explanation we appeal to the good sense of our Correspondent, at the same time thanking him for his concluding favour.&mdash;<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps;\">Ed. </span></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"^^rdf:HTML;
