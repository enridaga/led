        rdf:value   "<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;\">I watched with fascination and awe as a steeplejack put the final piece on the Skylon, which became a symbol of the Festival of Britain. For me, the other and more important iconic structure was the Royal Festival Hall, with its glass fa&ccedil;ade facing the river and its main function being music, was incredibly exciting. I worked nearby in a publishing office so was within easy reach of the box office of the Festival Hall. I remember booking for two piano recitals, one given by Claudio Arau [Arrau] and the other Arthur [Artur] Rubinstein. Instead the hall the light and spaciousness of the foyers lifted the spirits and made me feel in a receptive mood for what was to come. The acoustic seemed great even in the cheaper seats you could hear every soft note and the seats were incredibly comfortable. I was only twenty three at the time and enthusiastic about everything as you are at that age.</p>"^^rdf:HTML;
