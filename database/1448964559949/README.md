<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I came to concerts as a teenager with my parents soon after the hall opened. It was so new, modern and luxurious - all that space. We had never seen anything like it. In my physics studies at university in the later 1950,[1950's], the Royal Festival Hall was always quoted as an example of good acoustics.</p>
