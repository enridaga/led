<p>It was a very warm evening and my cousin and I were in seats at the front of the stalls with a clear view of the percussion in the orchestra. We were looking up at the stage where "Everyman" ballet was being performed - I switched my attention to the orchestra where the drummer was a very tiny man perched on a high stool - he leaned across to tune the big kettle drum - slipped off his stool and spreadeagled across the drum - quick as a flash the other persussionist seized him by his braces and popped him back on his stool!!</p>
