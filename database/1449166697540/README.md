<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">Travelling by train over Hungerford Bridge. We watched the Dome of Discovery being built on one side and the Festival Hall on the other side. A year later, walking back over the river to Children's Concerts. We sat on Red Cushions, behind the Orchestra. Dennis Brain played the French Horn, in front of us and we once heard Josephine Dupre [Du Pre]. Then at Christmas, they turned it into a theatre with huge curtains and Anton Dolin.</p>
