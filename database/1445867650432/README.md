<p>The Polyphonic Spree played for free in the Ballroom when they were over, as part of the Meltdown Festival. This was the first time I ever saw them and I was stunned. Twenty or so white-robed guys and galls, singing and playing their hearts out. It was the most exhilerating experience, the hairs on the back of my neck were standing on end and I felt an almost uncontrollable urge to jump up and down and wave my arms in the air.This is what it must be like to have a religious experience. My friends hated them.</p>
