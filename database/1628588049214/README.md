### comment


Mary (Molly) Prince was born into slavery in Bermuda 1787/88. The listening experiences occur when she was about thirty years old and had begun attending the Moravian Church, Antigua. Her experience of enslavement on Bermuda, Grand Turk and Antigua, in domestic settings, plantation work and in salt ponds, was brutal, including regular severe beatings by those who enslaved her. Her health was severely affected. She married self-emancipated Daniel James on Christmas Day, 1826; two years later her ‘owners’ John Adams Wood Jr and his wife took Mary with them to England where, with the support of the Moravian Church and abolitionist sympathisers she left the Woods’ household and tried to gain her freedom. She was unsuccessful, and after producing her narrative, she disappears from the historical record. 

Mary Prince’s harrowing narrative was the first personal account of slavery published in Britain by an enslaved black woman. Its production was a collaborative effort. She narrated her experiences to amanuensis Susanna Strickland. Anti-slavery advocates Thomas Pringle and Joseph Phillips compiled, edited and published the account.

<p style="margin: 9pt 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">My master and mistress [Mr and Mrs John Adams Wood Jr.] went on one occasion into the country, to Date Hill, for a change of air, and carried me with them to take charge of the children, and to do the work of the house. While I was in the country, I saw how the field negroes are worked in Antigua. They are worked very hard and fed but scantily.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 9pt 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">While we were at Date Hill Christmas came; and the slave woman who had the care of the place (which then belonged to Mr. Roberts the marshal), asked me to go with her to her husband's house, to a Methodist meeting for prayer, at a plantation called Winthorps. I went; and they were the first prayers I ever understood. One woman prayed; and then they all sung a hymn; then there was another prayer and another hymn; and then they all spoke by turns of their own griefs as sinners. The husband of the woman I went with was a black driver. His name was Henry. He confessed that he had treated the slaves very cruelly; but said that he was compelled to obey the orders of his master. He prayed them all to forgive him, and he prayed that God would forgive him. He said it was a horrid thing for a range<a name="FNanchor_11_11"></a>r to have sometimes to beat his own wife or sister; but he must do so if ordered by his master.</span></p>
