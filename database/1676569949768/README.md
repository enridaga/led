<p class="MsoNormal"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 150%; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">[Letter from Jemima Yorke to Mary Gregory, 8<sup>th</sup> May 1749]</span></strong></p>
<p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 0cm 7.5pt;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; color: black; mso-color-alt: windowtext; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">[...] I forgot in my last to mention a <u>great</u> &amp; <u>extraordinary</u> Event, one of those unexpected <u>fortunate</u> Events which may happen perhaps once in a whole Life, &amp; which help'd among other new &amp; surprizing Things to make the last Thanksgiving Week so <u>memorable</u>. &ndash; Guess it if you can? Nothing less I assure you than <u>the</u> <u>Hearing S.t Germain Play</u>. </span></p>
<p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 0cm 7.5pt;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; color: black; mso-color-alt: windowtext; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">This Party was made (I can't imagine how) at L.d Morton's: an Invitation from him to the Family at Powis-House (brought about accidentally in Conversation) &amp; to Us here, to dine with him &amp; hear Mons.r le Comte. We went accordingly, met him at Dinner &amp; spent the whole Evening together. After Tea, Coffee &amp;c., his Violin, a Harpsichord &amp; two or three other Instruments appeared &amp; they began. But unfortunately he had a dress'd Coat on which confin'd his Arms, &amp; makes him always very miserable, &amp; there followed many Ceremonies &amp; variety of Consultations about getting a Habit more to his Mind. At last a little Linen Bedgown of L.dy Browne's was proposed by her Ladyship ( who was come in to be of the Party as well as S.r Robert) a Messenger dispatch'd for it into the next Street, &amp; le Comte when attir'd in it made as much the figure of a Harlequin as you ever saw. But his Play indeed is delightful! The Violin in his Hands has all the Softness &amp; Sweetness of a Flute, &amp; yet all [the] Strength of the loudest Strings: his Execution is not of that rapid prodigious kind as Veracini &amp; Geminiani, but his Play is more easy &amp; harmonious &amp; his Excellence is Softness. He piques himself you know upon the Expression of the Passions in his Music especially the Tender Ones, &amp; both his Composition &amp; his Manner are almost all Affettuoso; for his Musick is entirely fitted to his own way of Performing &amp; would be nothing I am convinced from anybody else. After he had Play'd a considerable time, Frasi who had been appointed to meet him arrived after the Opera. She is his Favourite Singer I find, he teaches her his Songs &amp; sings Duetts with her &amp; her Only: but he also sung some Songs alone &amp; his Manner then is past all Description. I believe you was never honour'd with hearing him though he visited at your House so often. He has absolutely no Voice, what he sings with is entirely Feign'd &amp; so low that in a large Room it is quite lost, yet he will raise it sometimes to Thunder out a Song of Rage as much as he will Languish in One of Love: for his Action is still more Expressive than his Sounds. He accompanies himself without Book, &amp; addresses himself in all he has to express to the Company: he Frowns &amp; Scowls &amp; Threatens &amp; looks like a Fury when he is to be in a Passion, &amp; is so terribly Soft &amp; Languishing in his Tender Fits that there is no supporting it. &ndash; Woe! be to the Person within the reach of his Eye! for he makes Love so violently they must have a most Inflexible Countenance to stand it. As he is wholly posses'd by the part he is Acting. I believe it would be address'd equally to an Old Man or a Young Woman who was his next Neighbour, but poor Miss Yorke who happened to be in that Situation, &amp; not much used to be so address'd nor understanding what he was saying, would have been very glad to be out of it, &amp; look'd so Embarrass&eacute;e we were not a little diverted. &ndash; In short we stay'd there till Twelve o'Clock at Night &amp; were very much entertain'd either by him or at him the whole Time. &ndash;&ndash; I mean the Oddness of his Manner which it is impossible not to laugh at, otherwise you know he is very sensible &amp; well-bred in Conversation.</span></p>
<p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 0cm 7.35pt;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; color: black; mso-color-alt: windowtext; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">He was here at the Concert on Wednesday, &amp; as a great Favor staid late on purpose to give us a Couple of Songs when most of the Company were gone. It is vastly agreable as well as Odd to hear him. His Skill is certainly very great, &amp; his Songs are as much suited to his Expression in Singing as his Solos are to his Playing. I had never heard Justice done them before, even by his Other favorite Disciple. She fritters them &amp; makes them so fine that they are nothing: she apes his Manner without having his Force. But I have persuaded myself since I heard him to wonder less at her being so Caught. No Fine Lady can stand at his Elbow while he sings, &amp; fancy herself a real Object of all that Languishment without its going to her Heart. &ndash;&ndash;</span></p>
<p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 0cm 7.35pt;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; color: black; mso-color-alt: windowtext; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">He is an Odd Creature, &amp; the more I see him the more curious I am to know something about him. He is everything with everybody: he talks Ingeniously with M.r Wray, Philosophy with L.d Willoughby, &amp; is gallant with Miss Yorke, Miss Carpenter &amp; all the Young Ladies. But the Character of Philosopher is what he seems to pretend to, &amp; to be a good deal conceited of: the Others are put on to comply with Les Manieres du Monde, but That you are to suppose his real Charecteristick; &amp; I can't but fancy he is a great Pretender in all kinds of Science, as well as that he really has aquired an Uncommon Share in some. &ndash;&ndash;&ndash; Well! so much for Mons.r le Comte de S.t Germain, whom neither you nor I have anything to do with, (though he inquir'd very kindly after you:) &ndash;&ndash; And so &ndash;&ndash; Goodnight.</span></p>
