<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">My memory is one of the few London appearances of conductor Guido Cantelli who died tragically in an air crash at the age of 36. I was right at the back of the Grand Tier and saw 3000 people driven physically back in their seats as he 'let loose' the opening of the final movement of Tchaikovsky 4 [6?]. Their brains numbed, they made the mistake of leaning forward and were hurled back again as the motif was repeated. Had he lived 'so would Toscanini' and many of today's 'praise to the roof' performances would pale before him. My Karajan 'specials' are those selected by his promoter, Harold Holt. Bruckner 8, Mahler 6, and a building shattering 'Sacre'. He MAY have been a tyrant but I cried when he died.&nbsp;</p>
