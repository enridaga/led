<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I was 9 years old in 1951, my Grandparents were giving me a treat, a day in London. We had hot chocolate at Fortnum and Mason's, a visit to Harrods and Hamleys and to crown the day we went to the Festival Hall, my first visit, we saw "Spectre de la Rose". It was magical, so pretty and the dancing so brilliant and at the end when the doves flew in amazing. It made an impression on me I shall never forget. I have loved the ballet ever since. Thank you.</p>
