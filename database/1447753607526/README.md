<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">Attending my first concert with classical music.&nbsp; A school trip one Saturday morning; part of Sir Malcolm Sargent's programme for children.&nbsp; Carnival of Animals was the piece I remember but not who the narrator was.&nbsp; For an 8 year old quite an over-whelming experience.&nbsp; Travelling to London from mid Kent on a steamtrain.&nbsp; The size of the hall, which seemed full.&nbsp; The way the instruments "spoke".&nbsp; The piece remain a perennial favourite, as was Sir Malcolm, as I grew up and came to appreciate a wider range of classical music.</p>
