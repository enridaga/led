### value


<p>["Cutting contests" during rehearsals] would get them all prepared for the Battles of Jazz with the bands that were playing at the Roseland--the Dorsey Brothers, Casa Loma, Vincent Lopez, Jean Goldkette, and there was one band there that they called the Buffalodians that had a little kid playing piano. He was the boy who wrote "Stormy Weather". His name was [...] Harold Arlen.</p>
<p>But nobody could beat our [Fletcher Henderson's] band, not with people like Don Redman, and Louis [Armstrong], Bobby Stark, Joe Smith, Coleman Hawkins, Buster Bailey, Benny Carter, John Kirby, Big Green, and all the rest of the fine musicians that Fletcher had in those years. Just before one of those band battles were about to start Fletcher would say to the men, "Come on--let's take charge!". And they would PLAY! But you know, those other bands didn't mind at all. They'd be listenin' and getting ideas and inspiration.</p>
