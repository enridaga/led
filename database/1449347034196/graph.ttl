        rdf:value   "<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;\">At the time of the building of the Festival Hall, my father was involved as he was the London Director of Crittal Windows, the firm who supplied both doors and windows.&nbsp; The architect wanted clear glass for the main entry doors, but my father explained that these would be dangerous as people would walk into them and be injured.&nbsp; Instead, he suggested that they should have a bar across, or large handles specially designed.&nbsp; He also took part in the testing of the acoustics, sitting in various parts of the auditorium.&nbsp; We went to one of the earliest concerts - the second, I think.&nbsp; This was performed by Hepzibah and Yehudi Menhuin and we were thrilled, impressed, delighted and really felt that we would have heard a pin, if it had been dropped.&nbsp; We went to the Circle Bar in the interval.&nbsp; The view of London from the windows was breathtaking and we really felt peace had come. &nbsp;</p>"^^rdf:HTML;
