They would be new, the old having died; the present race, I may say, wearing their dress and inhabiting their houses without the least change in the general appearance.\r\n\r\nThe only instrument of music I saw was a bagpipe, like the small Lowland pipe, on which they play well.  Their gongs cannot be called a musical instrument.  When John Tuck, the deputy emperor, appears (he is so-called by the seamen on account of his having a gallows on board the grand boat which is a large as a seventy-four-gun ship and crowded with attendants) his band consists only of bagpipes.  Their gongs are only used that I heard to make tchin, tchin to Joss in bad weather, and at their paper sacrifices, and every vessel, down to the smallest sampan, has a Joss on board.\r\n"@en;
