<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I learned to love music at the Herbert [Ernest]&nbsp; Read family concerts. Once a month each winter all five of us came to the Festival Hall on a Saturday morning to listen to wonderful music, excellent orchestras + Herbert [Ernest] Read's explanations making it all come alive. Music has continued to give me untold pleasure and I have passed on that love to my own children, and now grandchildren.&nbsp;</p>
