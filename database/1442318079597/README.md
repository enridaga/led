### comment


John Evans-Pughe (1925 to 1996) was a chorister (with his younger brother Tom) at the choir of the College of St Nicholas, Chislehurst, under Sir Sydney Nicholson and later a music scholar at Kings School Canterbury, Kent. The St Nicholas choir was recorded for many BBC broadcasts and for Columbia Records. A Columbia recording in 1939 featuring John Evans-Pughe and Michael Lumb as treble soloists singing O Lovely Peace (Handel) and Brother Jamesâ€™ Air (arr. Jacob) was a best seller.

John did National Service in Egypt and Greece, and then studied science at Trinity College, Dublin. He went on to became an electronics engineer for Marconi Space and Defence Systems, continuing with music in his spare time.

<p>TO: The Rev. J and Mrs. Evans-Pughe,&nbsp; Tovil Vicarage, Maidstone, Kent</p>
<p>FROM: John Evans-Pughe, 14073964 L/Cpl Evans Pughe, S.I.C. c/o A.P.O SALONIKA, B.T.G (or British Forces in Greece)</p>
<p>DATE: August 11 1947</p>
<p>Dear Mummy and Daddy and Tom</p>
<p>    </p>
<p>&hellip;.I saw another very good French film on Friday.&nbsp; There was a very good singer &ldquo;Tino Rossi&rdquo; in it.&nbsp; He is a sort of cross between a tenor and a crooner, far superior to a crooner.&nbsp; He makes a sort of noise you could go on liking for days on end without being irritated by it&hellip;.</p>
