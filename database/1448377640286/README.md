<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">My first experience of live music was a school concert, which started with the 'Donna Diana' overture.&nbsp; I always remember that morning when I hear it now.&nbsp; We also sang at a schools carol concert which was broadcast on Children's Hour - I enjoyed telling everyone that I sang at the Festival Hall.</p>
