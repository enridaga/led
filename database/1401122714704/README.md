### has_evidence_text


I first visited the Royal Festival Hall during the Festival of Britain in 1951. "Palm Court Orchestra" - style recitals were held for about an hour each day with about four players, open to visitors to the Festival. I went to a concert either in the Autumn of '51 or Spring of '52 which included a performance of Brahms' double concerto. When I came to live in London in October '53 I regularly attended concerts, about 2 a month. In 1967 I sang with Croydon Philharmonic Society in a Royal Philharmonic Society concert where Kodaly was due to collect his gold medal but had died earlier. From 1968 to 1998 I regularly sang with the London Philharmonic Choir in many concerts.  I am now a benefactor of the LPO and attend about 15 concerts annually.
