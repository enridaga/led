<p class="MsoNormal">In his <em>Carnaval de Ventse</em>, he exhibited a mastery over every form of violin technics which quite reached the marvellous. His chromatic scale, played staccato from the lowest to the highest note, and down again to the lowest, in one bow,&mdash; either an up or down bow,&mdash;was a feat, a <em>tour de force</em>, shown us by no other virtuoso. His double trills and double harmonics were perfect. Nor was it in mere technical playing that he was great, for he played with much sentiment and feeling, and in quartette playing he showed his best quality. He was the master-player and king of all I have heard.</p>
