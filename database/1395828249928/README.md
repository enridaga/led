[T]o the Church of [illegible in original MS] to hear a messa in musica, (or a mass in figurative counterpoint) composed and under the direction of Signor Monza, Maestro di Capella. His brother played the violoncello with much facility of execution, but not a very pleasing tone or taste. The first violin, Signor Lucchini, who leads at the Burletta: 2 or 3 castrati sung. There was a paltry little organ erected on the occassion, though there is a large one in the church; but in a gallery too small for a band. The music was pretty. Long and ingenious introductory sinfonias to each concento or verse. The whole was in good taste and spirited; but the organ, hautbois and some of the fiddles being bad, destroyed the effect of several things that were well designed. The singing, though better than at our oratorios in general, yet not so perfect as we often hear in England at the Italian opera. As yet I have heard no great singer since my arrival in Italy. Signor Lucchini is about the same speed as a first violin with M. Lahanssay: there is no want of hand, but of high finishing. The 1st soprano was what we should call in England, a pretty good singer, with a pretty good voice; his taste neither original nor superior. The contralto, who was the second singer was likewise pretty well. His voice pleasing and he never gave offence by the injudicious management of it. But
"Tis in song as in painting
Much may be right yet much be wanting.â€™
However, one should not criticise such a performance as this too severely for one hears it for nothing. I speak as a traveller. But the people of Italy who contribute so much to the support of the church, are well entitled to these treats on the Feast of Dedication, which happens but once a year.
