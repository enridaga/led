<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 9pt 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Our voyage to the North Pole [May &ndash; September 1773] being ended, I returned to London [and] [&hellip;] began seriously to reflect on the dangers I had escaped [&hellip;]. It caused me to reflect deeply on my eternal state, and to seek the Lord with full purpose of heart ere it was too late.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 9pt 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">[&hellip;]</span></p>
<p style="margin: 9pt 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I had a great desire to read the bible the whole day at home [in London]; but not having a convenient place for retirement, I left the house in the day, rather than stay amongst the wicked ones; and that day as I was walking, it pleased God to direct me to a house where there was an old sea-faring man, who experienced much of the love of God shed abroad in his heart. He began to discourse with me [&hellip;] and invited me to a love-feast at his chapel that evening. I accepted the offer, and thanked him [&hellip;] When the wished-for hour came I went, and happily the old man was there, who kindly seated me, as he belonged to the place. I was much astonished to see the place filled with people, and no signs of eating and drinking. There were many ministers in the company. At last they began by giving out hymns, and between the singing the minister engaged in prayer; in short, I knew not what to make of this sight, having never seen any thing of the kind in my life before now [&hellip;] I wished to be as happy as them, and was persuaded in my mind that they were different from the world 'that lieth in wickedness,' 1 John v. 19. Their language and singing, &amp;c. did well harmonize; I was entirely overcome, and wished to live and die thus. Lastly, some persons in the place produced some neat baskets full of buns, which they distributed about; and each person communicated with his neighbour, and sipped water out of different mugs, which they handed about to all who were present. This kind of Christian fellowship I had never seen, nor ever thought of seeing on earth [&hellip;]; this entertainment (which lasted about four hours) ended in singing and prayer. It was the first soul feast I ever was present at.</span></p>

### comment


Olaudah Equiano was a leading black abolitionist in the late 18th century, his autobiography a vital means of campaigning against the slave trade and promoting his activities as a supporter of justice for other Africans in Britain. He was born 1745 in present-day south-eastern Nigeria. He was captured into the transatlantic slave trade 1755, purchasing his freedom 1766. As an enslaved boy and as a free man, Equiano worked aboard ships in the Caribbean and American colonies becoming an adept seaman and trader. He was a devout Christian. In 1792 he married Susanna Cullen in Cambridgeshire; they had two daughters, Ann Maria and Joanna. Equiano died in London, 1797. His burial place, a cemetery in Tottenham Court Road, was located in 2018.
