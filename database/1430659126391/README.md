As soon as we arrived in Boston, we stopped by the club we were playing, which was medium-sized and rather dingy. Then we checked into a nearby Holiday Inn and returned to start setting up the gear. Things were complicated by the fact that the performances were not only being recorded live on audio, but also filmed on videoâ€¦

Luckily, we had enough lead time at Kix to iron out any problems, and the shows went off without a hitch. The song selection was eclectic: something old, something new, something borrowed, and definitely something blue. Miles was leaning back toward his fifties tendency of borrowing a pop tune and injecting it with a bit of sophistication. He also had a number called "Fat Time," named for Mike Stern, where Mikey could rock out. The band dipped into the past, as well, with "My Man's Gone Now," which Miles played as a straight blues, connecting directly to his St. Louis/Kansas City roots in a way that he never did in the mid-seventies. It was sort of a hodge-podge, which was to be expected. Miles was finding his way to a new synthesis, using all of the various musical elements he had absorbed over the years. As always, the music and Miles were both works in progress.
