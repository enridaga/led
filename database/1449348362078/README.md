<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">1951: I was a 16 year old schoolgirl. My friend Hugh queued all night to get tickets for the opening week; Toscanini was to conduct. He got us two, but Toscanini was ill and I've forgotten who the substitute was. Anyway, it was a wondrous new and modern hall, with strange acoustics</p>
