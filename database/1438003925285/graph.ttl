It will encourage the boy. Promise me that you will go.\" And BEETHOVEN went. When the \"little LISZT\" stepped on to the platform, he saw BEETHOVEN in the front row; it nerved instead of staggering him he played with an abandon and inspiration which defied criticism. Amidst the storm of applause which followed, BEETHOVEN was observed to step up on the platform, take the young virtuoso in his arms, and salute him, as LISZT assured me, \"on both cheeks.\" This was an event not to be lightly forgotten, and hardly after fifty-seven years to be alluded to without a certain awe; indeed, LISZT'S voice quite betrayed his sense of the seriousness of the occasion as he repeated, with a certain conscious pride and gravity, \"Oui, j'ai recu le baiser de BEETHOVEN.\" <span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;\"><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\"> <br /></span></span></p>"^^rdf:HTML;
