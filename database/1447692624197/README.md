<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">Still a schoolgirl I made my first visit to the Royal Festival Hall on the last day of the wonderful, lauded and controversial Festival of Britain.&nbsp; My friend and I were a little late, but had to stop running for the entrance during the playing of the National Anthem.&nbsp; Everything inside the Hall was magical; we were in awe.&nbsp; After obeying the get to your seats 5 minute 'boing' for the first time, we sat in the cheapest seats behind the Orchestra and fell in love with the young brilliant conductor Guido Cantelli, a protege of the great Toscanini.&nbsp; The Orchestra was the Philharmonia perhaps newly formed.&nbsp; I visited the Hall over the next few weeks experiencing music from a vast swathe of composers.&nbsp; It was a time I shall always remember with gratitude.&nbsp; I have loved the RF Hall ever since and still feel at each visit an enduring affection.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
