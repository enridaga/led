Soe I believe it will not last. Yours will be much the same but for the Fraternity that supports it. The ArchDutchess gives handsomely, but there are but 4 Boxes taken untill Lent. The Price of Hornes one they are soe Dear that there are but few that can Support it, and besides the Language not understood, I goe only for the Ayres, the Musick is admirable and the Reciterings tyres me not understanding Italian, but in the Booke, is [illegible word] the Plott of each Scene in French. LaDotti thats come from England takes mightily, she is perfectly good, and always Smiling whether Singing or Speaking. The first time she Saw me makeing her Court to a Lady in the Box, I thought she would have taken me about the Neck takeing me for my Bro. James. She told me She had Sometimes Cause to be troubled, but she finds it is not good for her health, and that she shall live the longer by being good humoured. She is of a very good Character, but her husband a little extravagant. She began in representing Queen Elisabeth in the Opera of the Earl of Essex and it was charming. We have had 2 mighty Feasts, of St. Charles and St. Elizabeth the Emperor, and Empresse&rsquo;s names. The Courtage to the Great Church was magnificent, as likewise all at Court after, on the first day, the Grand Maitre &amp; First Minister according to Custom treated most magnificently at Dinner of 50 all men of the First Rank of Foreigne Ministers, Lords of the Court and Towne. The ArchDutchesse gave the Opera &amp; Ball gratis, greatly illuminated, and She Supped in the Appartment joyning to the Opera built by the late Electer for that purpose and the Ladys of the Court have a great Table and they invite Somechief of the nobility of Men, to keep them Company. My plaine Suit with a fine Vest is well accepted of because it is known I never weare any other. At the latter the 19.<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;there was great Solemnity at Church and Dinner at Court. The Opera was greatly illuminated but not gratis, and after the Arch Dutchesses Supper, all the Ladys at Court and Towne that are of any Rank met at the Grand Maitre&rsquo;s and the Men were invited also that were of Rank. The Great Appartment above was vastly lighted as that below at Supper. They danced till Supper came up. There was 3 Great Tables of the Ladys, but they tooke Some men of the cheif Nobility to each and the 3 other Tables were all men. The First Table was for the Ladys of the Court, they take place before all others here, which is not in England, nor in France. One of the Ladys of the Bed Chamber a very good Friend, desired me three or 4 days before, that I would sit by her. The Ball after lasted long, but I came home Soon.</p>
