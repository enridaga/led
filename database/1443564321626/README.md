<p>The music was the problem, as a piano was unthinkable &hellip; I sent for Edmund [Rubbra], who immediately suggested an orchestra of members of the company. &nbsp;&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; I cried. &nbsp;&ldquo;I can only spare four, and only two of them have ever played any instrument in their lives!&rdquo; &nbsp;&ldquo;That will be all right,&rdquo; said he. &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have very simple instruments. &nbsp;What have you got?&rdquo; &nbsp;A search among our instruments brought to light a varied collection. &nbsp;He chose an Indian drum and cymbals, a wooden pipe with four notes, a triangle, and a cowbell. &nbsp;Stephen Jack produced an ocarina, which he played with skill. &nbsp;&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Edmund. &nbsp;&ldquo;All we require now is a xylophone.&rdquo; &nbsp;And he departed with the gramophone records, to turn up a week later with a score. &nbsp;He had, he said, caused a domestic upheaval by playing the records for a whole week-end, after which, having saturated his mind with Eastern modes and rhythms, he had composed something on the same lines.</p>
<p>Edmund allotted to the startled actors their various instruments, and, true to Arts League traditions, they tackled their parts with a will. &nbsp;The result was pandemonium, but after some rehearsals the final effect was very charming. &nbsp;True, the orchestra was not always perfect, but neither were the conditions under which they had to play, and once or twice hysteria nearly got the better of them. &nbsp;I can still see them, Stephen, with his ocarina, dressed for the sea chanties; Hugh Mackay, in his black cloak, with the Indian pipe; Sidney Young, in charge of both the xylophone and drum; Elizabeth Dore, Victorian in checks and pantalettes, with the cowbell; all crouched behind the curtains in a wing space two feet wide with only a flickering candle by which to see their instruments.</p>
