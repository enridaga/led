### comment


The letter is dated 17th September, but the author's account suggests that the concert and ball may have taken place up to six weeks beforehand.  Elsewhere in the letter the writer mentions that the following attended: Duke (of Dorset) and Lady Lambert, Lord Bellfield, Lord Masserene, Lord Kingsborough, Sir Ralph and Dick Gore, Jack St Leger and Frank Barton etc. The Duchess of Dorset was too ill to attend.

I should but if you knew how I was circumstanced in Dublin you wou&rsquo;d readily forgive me; for in truth from the time I got up in the morning till I went to Bed, I never had one Moment to myself for we are so Genteel that there are, new Diversions for Every hour of the Day, but now that I am return&rsquo;d to Cellbridge &amp; have had time to collect my scatter&rsquo;d Senses, &amp; to Set my Little intellect into some sort of Order, I may perhaps be able to Either Speak, write or think like a Rational Creature, for really for these last Six weaks I&rsquo;ve lived in a continual hurry, &amp; have hardly yet got the Buzz of that great Metropolis out of my Ears. Now for the Ball [...] Next to this Temple was a vast pile of Rocks, on w<sup>ch</sup> was a vast number of Musicians, all in Rural Dresses w<sup>ch</sup> look&rsquo;d Exceessive pretty [...] the Concert was Extremely Agreable, Andrews &amp; Leander the famous French horns play&rsquo;d several pieces &amp; were so sittuated, one always appear&rsquo;d an Echo to the other &amp; as they sat on the highest Rocks the soun&rsquo;d was not too much for the Room; at the Close of this harmony my Ears were, all on a Sudden, Saluted with Innumerable Birds of various kinds that seem&rsquo;d to me as if they were in the Trees, &amp; were, so well immitated, that they who have had the Pleasure of hearing the Nightingales said nothing coud be more natural &amp; for the Larks, &amp; thrushes I will answer for them thus thei sung alternately, till near ten o&rsquo;Clock when this delightful Melody ceased, &amp; the Members of this little Choir each retired, I suppose, to its lofty habitation for we heard them no more [...] after the Concert was over we danced, &amp; did not comes away till 5 o&rsquo;clock in all which time I never saw any thing carried on w<sup>th</sup> greater regularity, &amp; not one Drunken Man in the room excapt some of the Waiters &amp; Musicians who made a little too free, w<sup>th</sup> Capes &amp; Champagne.</span></p>
