The Eolus of harmony appeared forthwith, and, having duly prepared himself by the donative of a glass of strong grog, began his performance with "The flowers of Edinburgh," in which the treble pipes went with rapid execution over a number of notes, while the uninterrupted monotonous snorting of one or two larger tubes formed a sostenuto bass-accompaniment of peculiar elegance.

Indeed, on being proudly asked how he liked the tune, he by no means minced his opinion, but broadly declared, that he was glad to see the company so well amused by it, and, <em>on that account</em>, could not but approve of what, afforded pleasure to his friends, even at the expense of his own taste; to follow the dictates of which, he was bound to say, that he would as soon hear the squallings of half a dozen of famished brats, as the grating sounds of so barbarous an instrument. Upon this unexpected remark, our hosts were civil enough to put an end to the first act of the concert by dismissing Mr. M'Murdoch with his bagpipes. </span></p>
