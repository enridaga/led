I remember being a little dissapointed [disappointed] at the contents of the Dome of discovery, although the rest of the Festival was really exciting for me and my pal. The R.F.H. however was to us like a Cathedral, simply wonderful. We saw our first concert which was the "Modernjazz quartet" and to two school leavers it was mind blowing. Since then I have seen all the U.S. big bands (legends) also the one and only Frank Sinatra (78). My last visit (also a jazz concert) was with my 16 year old son who play clarinet in school band (last year). Can't wait for the opening of my R.F.H.
