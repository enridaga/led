*Excerpt*

### value


<p class="MsoNormal">On Tuesday the Congregational musical leader, Ieuan Gwyllt, visited Pisgah Chapel, Penygraig, to test the congregational singing in the district. The choirs present were those of Pisgah, Porth, Ferndale, Dina and Llwynypia. The meetings were held at ten, two, and six o&rsquo; clock... The highly respectable aspect of this large congregation, in the midst of the present strike&hellip; would have surprised a stranger visiting the valley. The chapel was crowded to excess. The choirs filled the semi-circular gallery &ndash; women on the right and the men on the left, while downstairs was filled by those who were not members of the choirs. But most of them appeared to understand the music and joined heartily both in chants, psalms and anthems. Ieuan Gwyllt, it was stated had attended magnificent musical meetings held at Aberdare on Monday last, where he declared that the singing in the part of South Wales of which Aberdare was the centre, was the best to be found in the whole world. Coming, as the examiner did, fresh from the centre of excellence, one would naturally conclude that the task before the choirs to reach his critical standard was not an easy one. I am glad, however, to state that, fresh from the school of the prophets as he was, the singing here appeared to please him. He stood in the pulpit and led the choirs in an able manner. He repeatedly complimented the singers upon the feeling they displayed, and the singing appeared to make a deep impression upon all present. The reverend chairman stated that he had never attended meetings of this kind where the audience entered more thoroughly &lsquo;through the letter to the spirit&rsquo; of what they sang.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The great feature of these meetings was anthem singing and Psalm chanting. The rendering of the Psalms by the choirs was simply grand beyond description. There may have been room for technical [sic], but the volume for melody was superb&hellip;. Ieuan Gwyllt said they were now entering upon a new epoch in Welsh music&hellip;.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During the afternoon service a hymn entitled &lsquo;The Fig Tree&rsquo; was sung. The speaker prefaced each hymn with some remarks explanatory of the work. He here told the audience that Jesus Christ had been to Bethany, etc., etc.... He searched among the leaves, but found no fruit. He found nothing but leaves. The speaker then forcibly applied the lesson, and gave out the hymns which were sung with wonderful pathos....</p>
