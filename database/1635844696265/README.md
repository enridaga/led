The aim of the project ‘Fire is Tiger’ was to involve children in music composition for percussion and to compose poetry, a cross-curricular approach best suited to the needs of the pupils. The Cherry Trees school is a special primary for boys with emotional and behavioural difficulties.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">I was privileged to be among the audience [at 'Fire is Tiger'] on Friday and was deeply impressed at the quality of the work presented. It has always been my experience that the involvement of professional artists enriches the curriculum and this has certainly been the case at The Cherry Trees. The input of the poet and musicians from the[Spitalfields] Festival clearly enhanced the boys&rsquo; motivation and raised their attainment.&nbsp;</span></p>

### comment


The Spitalfields Festival has been, since 1976, a major professional music event in the East End of London. Listening experiences relate to the Festival’s Education and Community Programme (ECP), launched in 1989. It devises education projects with schools and community groups that reflect these groups’ concepts and practices of the arts. The ECP is collaborative, linking musicians, writers and visual artists, and the Spitalfields Festival, with East End of London children, adults and elderly people.
