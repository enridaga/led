<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 12.4pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; margin: 0cm 23.0pt .0001pt 0cm;">But at Frankfort, during the fair, there was a German opera, which gave me considerable pleasure. I there saw the Achilles and the Camilla of Pa<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">&euml;</span>r, the Axur R<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">&eacute;</span> d&rsquo;Ormus of Salieri, the Cosa rara of Martini, and other lighter pieces, all well performed. The first female singer was Madame Lang, who had long enjoyed a high reputation in Germany. She sung with science, and considerable execution, very much in Mara&rsquo;s style; but her voice was evidently in decay, and it was easy to see she had been better. A Mademoiselle Muller sung very agreeably in the comic operas. The first man, named Krebs, was come to Frankfort only for the fair, from Stutgard, the place of his engagement. He had a good tenor voice, and sung well. I saw him again at Stutgard, in a charming opera of Weigl, of which the Italian name is L&rsquo;Amor Marinaro, and it was excellently sung and acted throughout. The first woman, Madame Gley, was a very pleasing performer in every respect; in her person (and she appeared in male attire), as a singer, and as an actress. A duetto between her and Krebs being called for a second time, they repeated it to the Italian words.</p>
