<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">When fourteen years of age, I saved five shillings of my wages, with which I bought an old violin. This occupied all my leisure hours, and has been my favourite amusement ever since. I had commonly no spare time from [shepherding] during the day; but when I was not over-fatigued, I generally spent an hour or two every night in sawing over my favourite old Scottish tunes&mdash;my bed being always in stables and cow-houses, I disturbed nobody but myself. This brings to my remembrance an anecdote, the consequence of one of these nocturnal endeavours at improvements.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">When serving with Mr. Scott of Singlee, there happened to be a dance one evening, at which a number of the friends and neighbours of the family were present. I, being admitted to the room as a spectator, was all attention to the music; and, on the company breaking up, I retired to my stable-loft, and fell to essaying some of the tunes to which I had been listening. The musician going out on some necessary business, and not being aware that another of the same craft was so near him, was not a little surprised when the tones of my old violin assailed his ears. At first he took it for the late warbles of his own ringing through his head; but, on a little attention, he, to his horror and astonishment, perceived that the sounds were real,-- and that the tunes, which he had lately been playing with so much skill, were now murdered by some invisible being hard by him. Such a circumstance at that dead hour of the night, and&nbsp;&nbsp;when he was unable to discern from what quarter the sounds proceeded, convinced him all at once that it was a delusion of the devil; and, suspecting his intentions from so much familiarity, he fled precipitately into the hall, with disordered garments, and in the utmost perturbation, to the no small mirth of Mr. Scott, who declared, that he had lately been considerably stunned himself by the same discordant sounds.&nbsp;</p>
