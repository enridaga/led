<p>An interesting account of Gibbons playing the organ and directing the choir in Westminster Abbey is given in the "Life of Archbishop Williams," sometime Lord Keeper of the Great Seal. By command of the King, a supper was given in the Jerusalem Chamber, to the French Ambassadors who came over to arrange the marriage of the Prince of Wales (afterwards Charles I.) to the French Princess Henrietta Maria. But before the supper (as Bishop Racket, of Lichfield) describes: "The Embassadors, with the Nobles and Gentlemen in their Company, were brought in at the North-gate of the Abby, which was stuck with Flambeaux everywhere, both within and without the Quire, that strangers might cast their Eyes upon the stateliness of the Church. At the Door of the Quire the Lord Keeper besought their Lordships to go in, and to take their seats there for a while, promising in the Word of a Bishop that nothing of ill Rellish should be offered before them; which they accepted; and at their Entrance the Organ was touch'd by the best Finger of that Age, Mr. Orlando Gibbons. While a verse was plaid, the Lord Keeper presented the Embassadors and the rest of the Noblest Quality of their Nation with our Liturgy, as it spake to them in their own Language; and in the Delivery of it used those few Words, but pithy, That their Lordships at Leisure might Read in that Book in what Form of Holiness our Prince worshipp'd God; wherein he durst say nothing savour'd of any Corruption of Doctrine, much less of Heresie; which he hoped would be so reported to the Lady Princess Henrietta.The Lord Embassadors and their Great Train took up all the Stalls, where they continued about half an hour, while the Quiremen, vested in their Rich Copes, with their Choristers, sang three several Anthems with most exquisite Voices before them."</p>
