<p>Tuesday was the day appointed for Mr. Roberts to visit this place. At 10 o'clock the meeting was commenced in Pisgah Chapel by the Rev. W. Evans, Tonyrefail, who read a portion of Scripture and offered a prayer. Mr. Roberts then having stated the objects of the meeting, several tunes were sung, addresses being given at intervals by the Rev. W. Evans, J. Roberts and T. Rees (of Penygraig). At two o'clock the opening service was performed by the Rev. W. Selwyn Davies, Ferndale. The singers were much stronger in the afternoon than in the morning, and consequently there was better singing. At six o'clock the Rev. T. George (of Bethania, Dinas), conducted the opening service. Long before six o'clock almost every foot of space was occupied, and many visitors were obliged to retrace their steps, having failed to gain admittance. Mr Roberts addressed the meeting very forcibly, and related his experience during his stay with Messrs Moody and Sankey, in Scotland, Liverpool, and London. He raised the congregation to such a pitch that there were but few who had not wet eyes. The singing was good beyond description, and several of the tunes were repeated. When one of the revival songs were sung, the vast audience could no longer contain itself, but burst out in one shout of praise. The emotion of the moment wil not soon be forgotten. After the singing was over, Mr. Roberts invited all who felt a desire to give themselves up to Jesus of Nazareth to remain behind, to which invitation 35 responded. Mr. Roberts went to each of them personally to offer them a word of encouragement, and thus terminated one of the most remarkable and successful meetings ever held in the district.</p>
