What suited me better were the &ldquo;Service of Songs&rdquo;which were held once or twice a year. These were, as a rule Sentimental Stories set to music. There was a reader who read out to the congregation a portion of the story-- then some singing and so on to the bitter end. Some of these &ldquo;Service of Songs&rdquo; were super sentimental. Talk about floods of tears from the ladies-- we could have done with a &ldquo;Second Ark&rdquo;! The "reader" at these S. of Songs was a Mrs. Day, wife of Job Day, the founder of &ldquo;Day&rsquo;s dry soap works&rdquo; whose works at that time was not far away from my dad&rsquo;s [cobblers] shop.&nbsp;</span></p>
