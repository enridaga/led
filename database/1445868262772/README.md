<p>My memory of the RFH is watching Fischerspooner at David Bowie's Meltdown perform their encore with silver glitter falling from the ceiling and the crowd going mad. It was the perfect finale for a totally extravagant, over the top evening.&nbsp; After the show the support act Chili Gonzalez did an impromptu gig (by the bar area) and I remember thinking who on earth is this incredibly sweaty, very hairy man in a dressing gown?&nbsp; Within ten minutes of his piano playing I had totally fallen in love with him! Hope that's useable - Ali was keen we sent through memories and I'm afraid that's the best I can do!</p>
