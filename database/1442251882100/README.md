### comment


John Evans-Pughe (1925 to 1996) was a chorister (with his younger brother Tom) at the choir of the College of St Nicholas, Chislehurst, under Sir Sydney Nicholson and later a music scholar at Kings School Canterbury, Kent. The St Nicholas choir was recorded for many BBC broadcasts and for Columbia Records. A Columbia recording in 1939 featuring John Evans-Pughe and Michael Lumb as treble soloists singing O Lovely Peace (Handel) and Brother Jamesâ€™ Air (arr. Jacob) was a best seller. 
John did National Service in Egypt and Greece, and then studied science at Trinity College, Dublin. He went on to became an electronics engineer for Marconi Space and Defence Systems, continuing with music in his spare time.

<p>TO: The Rev. J and Mrs. Evans-Pughe, Tovil Vicarage, Maidstone, Kent</p>
<p>FROM: John Evans-Pughe, ON ACTIVE SERVICE, Cairo, Egypt, 14073964 Signals section, C.S.D.I.C.</p>
<p>DATE: Tuesday 26th [month?] 1946</p>
<p>&hellip;I might be able to buy some sort of suit out here, or I should say in about 2 months time, because I&rsquo;ve just purchased a brand new violin complete with case and bow for about &pound;8&hellip;whether I shall be able to collect it depends entirely on the behaviour of the students in Cairo.&nbsp; They are behaving rather awkwardly at the moment, agitating against the government&hellip;</p>
<p>I enclose program of concert I went to at &ldquo;Music for All Club&rdquo; on Saturday; All the players except &lsquo;Hoenner&rsquo; (?) are German Prisoners.&nbsp; There is also a Symphony orchestra, here comprised of German prisoners.&nbsp; They give very very good performances.&nbsp; The club is marked on the map I sent you.&nbsp; The first two items were very very good.&nbsp; The pianist was very good, but I didn&rsquo;t like the piece he played&hellip;.</p>
