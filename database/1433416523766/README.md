<p>I had a brass band too. When I got a job I'd supply any number of men they wanted. If I didn't have them, I could pick them up. I had a sign on my house, "ORCHESTRA AND BRASS BAND". You couldn't miss it. At that time they used to advertise dances and picnics by hiring a wagon with a big sign on the side with the band playing in the wagon. I decided I'd try a new idea and advertise my band that way. I rented a furniture wagon and told a fellow to make signs "KID ORY", with address and telephone number. After that I began to get lots of class for jobs and got real well known&hellip;</p>
<p>They used to have "cutting contests" every time you'd get on the streets. Freddie Keppard's band whipped us good because he was a stronger trumpet player than we had at first. Then we started whipping everybody. The public was on my side. When the other band was finished, they'd tie the wagons together. The crowd tied them to keep them from running away from us.</p>
<p>I used to say "I'll let you go when I think you should go". Mutt Carey's brother played trombone. I liked him but he didn't like me. He was kind of jealous because Mutt came to play with me. I gave him a spanking in a contest. He stopped me afterward on the corner and said, "He can beat me playing trombone, but he can't whip me!" I threw my arms around him and said, "I just love you, Jack." He turned out to be a preacher before he passed.</p>
