### value


<p>The Freddie Keppard Creole Band was tremendous. They really played jazz. The reason [George] Baquet, the clarinet, played straight, more or less, was because he was the only one who could read and they had him play the lead for that reason. He played it rather straight, down low. I never heard a man that could beat Keppard--his reach was so exceptional, both high and low, with all degrees of power, great imagination, and more tone than anybody. Any little place in the music that didn't have any notes on, he would fill right up. He really couldn't read a note. Liked to hear the tune first, because he didn't want to admit he couldn't read. He frequently found excuses; he would be having valve trouble, fingering the valves, shaking the instrument, spitting it out; all the while he would be listening. Somebody would bawl him out and he would say, "Go ahead, I'll play my part!". Next time, he would pick up his horn and play right through the number.</p>
