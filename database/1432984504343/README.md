<p>Dr. Maclean made some graceful references to our service at the Abbey, and to me. I venture to give an extract : "Sir Frederick Bridge, whose energy is inexhaustible in illustrating the great features of his country's music, and to whom every anniversary is a festal day, marked St. Peter's Day with functions at the Abbey commemorative of S. S. Wesley's birth-centenary. Along with the religious service for the day, eight of the great anthems were sung in the Nave by a choir of two hundred and fifty, with organ accompaniment (Alcock), but conducted from a rostrum (Bridge), and so rendered with vigour and expression. The effect was supremely impressive Later an organ-recital of eight of the S. S. Wesley organ-works by eight different organists, the most effective being Choral Song and Fugue (Kendrick Pyne) and National Anthem with Fugue (Bridge) . . ."</p>
