<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Cambria;">At one time when I went to the Sunday Evening service at St Mary&rsquo;s le Strand, a few of us used to meet in a room afterwards for coffee and a chat, and someone had the bright idea of forming a Concert party. We went every Sunday for rehearsals; we thought up a few sketches, had a &ldquo;comic&rdquo;, a pianist, and me singing. Oh the confidence of youth! We decided, would you believe, to hire the Croydon Town hall no less, for a show. We could only hope to sell tickets to friends or colleagues at the office. When I think of that night, I squirm. There was this huge hall, with not more than twenty people in the audience, one &ldquo;old dear&rdquo; in the front row knitting throughout, and we all giving of our best, which was truly terrible. Never again! One of the boys, who had some of his office pals there, asked them next day what they thought of it, and they said diabolical, except for the girl who played piano (the Boy&rsquo;s girl friend) and the girl who sang!</span></p>
