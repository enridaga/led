My name is Joseph J.Brown I was born on the 7th December 1924 at 63 Omoa Road in the village of Cleland in Lanarkshire. I was educated at St Mary's school in the village and in 1935 successfully passed the entrance examination to Motherwell Higher Grade school when I was 11 years old. 
The years up to 1939 had seen tremendous preparation for war, aeroplanes were to be seen most days on training flights, factories in Motherwell and other towns were being camouflaged. At school we had each been issued with a gas mask in a cardboard box which had a string to hang round your neck, it was supposed to be compulsory to carry them but we soon got fed up dragging them everywhere with us so they were left at home and by December 1939 they were chucked in a drawer and never used again. We never had any practice in their use.

LATER...

I can clearly remember listening to Radio Warsaw on that fateful day when Paderewski the Polish pianist and prime minister played the piano "Chopin's Polonaise" and continued to play until the city had fallen and the radio fell silent.

The British and French Governments had issued Hitler with an ultimatum stating he had to withdraw from Poland by the 3rd September, as this did not happen war was declared by Neville Chamberlain on Sunday 3rd September 1939.

### comment


The BBC's WW2 People's War project ran from June 2003 to January 2006. The aim of the project was to collect the memories of people who had lived and fought during World War Two on a website; these would form the basis of a digital archive which would provide a learning resource for future generations. 
The target audience, people who could remember the war, was at least 60 years old. Anyone who had served in the armed forces during the war was, at the start of the project, at least 75. Most of them had no experience of the internet. Yet over the course of the project, over 47,000 stories and 14,000 images were gathered. A national story gathering campaign was launched, where 'associate centres' such as libraries, museums and learning centres, ran events to helped gather stories. Many hundereds of volunteers, many attached to local BBC radio stations, assisted in this. Read more about how the stories were gathered. 
The resulting archive houses all of these memories. These stories don't give a precise overview of the war, or an accurate list of dates and events; they are a record of how a generation remembered the war, 60 years of more after the events, and remain in the Archive as they were contributed. The Archive is not a historical record of events, a collection of government or BBC information, recordings or documents relating to the war..
