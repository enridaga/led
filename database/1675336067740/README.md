### comment


'Songsters' is used here as a derogatory term, indicating that the singer in question has fallen, as Riley puts it 'a Sacrifice to the Love of Pleasure'.

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It has been remarked that some of the finest Treble Voices that the Cathedrals have produced, notwithstanding the Advantage of a musical Education, have (when broke) turned out extremely bad. What then can be expected in Charity-Schools, where they are not taught any Rules to regulate their Voices by? In the Course of my teaching this Way, I believe I have taught about Five Hundred Children to sing the Solos and other particular Parts of the Hymns, who are always selected from the rest for this Purpose; among whom, I solmenly declare that I have not had more than Five whose Voices were remarkably good, whereas most of the were capable of learning their Hymns so fast, that I have been astonished; and the Ears of some have been so extremely nice, that I have taught them to sing in three Parts, to the great Wonder of all musical People that have heard them. Should any of those Children then hereafter turn out Songsters, it cannot be reasonably attributed to their Instruction; and to suppose that every Youth that Nature has endowed with a good Voice or Ear, must consequently fall a Sacrifice to the Love of Pleasure, I think, is rather uncharitable.</p>
