<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I remember going to the Royal Festival Hall in the early 50s when I was at my last school. I attended a school concert there. It was a a school outing. I think it was about 1956 as I remember it was a lovely concert that was my first visit to the Royal Festival Hall.</p>
