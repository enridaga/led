It is now however almost as difficult to find one who can sing a Venetian ballad as one who can chaunt verses from&nbsp;<em>Tasso</em>.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">&nbsp;This poet [Tasso] has been, as you know, translated into all or nearly all the Italian dialects, but with most success into that of this state, ministering matter for their music to the gondoleers of former times. But \"the songs of other years\" have died away. I requested one, the other day, from a man who was said to be amongst the last depositories of them; but found I had touched a tender string in asking for a song of Sion. He shook his head, and told me that, \"in times like these, he had no heart to sing.\"</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">&nbsp;This boat -music was destined for the silence and solitude of the night; but it should seem that some of our countrymen entertain very different notions on this subject; as I saw lately a sober-looking Englishman, with his wife and child, embarked on the grand canal at mid-day, with two violins and a drum. Yet they did not look like people who would have paraded Bond Street, at the time of high water with fiddles in a barouche.</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>"^^rdf:HTML;
