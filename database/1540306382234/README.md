<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #333333;">Mr. Brindley and Mr. Len Denison were my colleagues during my time as Steward (at Woodhouse Carr Methodist Church], and very good colleagues they were, and we got along like a &ldquo;house on fire&rdquo;. Mr. Brindley (as Choir Master and Organist) was often encouraged as quite a number of our preachers made reference to the very good singing of our congregation. The singing certainly was good, for they were led by a Choir who were well trained in the singing of hymns Old and New. Hymnology and the interpretation of hymns were the special study of our Choirmaster. We hadn&rsquo;t a large Choir, but it was an enthusiastic one, and I was happy to be a member of it for many years. Choir practice was looked forward to each Thursday Evening, and apart from the singing, it was a happy get-together among friends.&nbsp;</span></p>
