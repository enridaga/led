        rdf:value   "<p>In early 1958 I met a girl, whom I found more than merely appealing - she was lovely. Wanting to make a first date something memorable, but not having the faintest idea if she would enjoy \"serious\" music, I decided I concert at the RFH would do the trick. It did, and we have been married for 47 years. Edna remains lovely despite having suffered a number of strokes. She no longer has black hair or is a size 8, but I cannot imagine life without her. The concert programme that was such a success! Saturday 26th April 1958. LPO, Marriage of Figaro Overture; Schubert's \"Unfinished\", Tchaikovsky 1st Piano Concerto. Finally Dvorak New World Symphony. Probably the most romantic programme possible.</p>"^^rdf:HTML;
