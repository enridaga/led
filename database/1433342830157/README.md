<p>It was not rare to see funerals which had three or four brass bands in the procession, because a member probably was active in eight to twelves organizations--Masons, Odd fellows, Tulane Club or Zulu Club, the Vidalia, Veterans, Charity, and a few more.</p>
<p>It was more than likely his request to be buried as he lived, among a crowd and lots of music. As in the case of Giles, the greatest of them all, the Excelsior Brass Band's bass drummer--and Black Benny. Every musician in New Orleans offered their services.</p>
<p>On both occasions it was a sad sight to see their silent bass drums draped in mourning, carried by a close friend behind the hearse. The money earned (three or four dollars) was and still is called "fun money" and is usually quickly spent for drinks after the musicians disband.</p>
