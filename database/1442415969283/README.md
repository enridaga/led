<p>It was my first real concert with Pete Katin as a soloist with my first real boyfriend- Dr. Terry Lee - the first of many attendences at the South Bank ( unfortunately only one with Terry some thirty years later). I think I still have the programme?&hellip;&hellip;I was probably 18 and felt so grown -up.</p>
