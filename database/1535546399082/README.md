He pulled his barrel organ on two wheels from street to street. He didn&rsquo;t shout, but just stopped in the street and started to turn the handle of his organ. He was always accompanied by any children who were not at school and who would ask their parents for &ldquo;A Penny for the Tingalary Man&rdquo; often children followed him from street to street like a modern Pied Piper.&nbsp;</span></p>
