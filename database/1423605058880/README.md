I had a Saturday job at Selfridges and this meant travelling up to London every Saturday. I was doing my A levels at a technical college and my close friend Don and I decided to go to the RFH after my work to wait and see if we could get a ticket for Joni MItchell's sell out concert. We managed to get a really cheap ticket in the front row of the choir stalls. For one entire song she turned and played to us, just to us, in the front row of the choir stalls, or so it seemed. What a magical evening.
