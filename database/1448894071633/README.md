<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">Concerts: A young and unknown George Solti conducting Schubert's 9th Symphony (circa 1955?). A Beethoven cycle by Boult and the LPO (1955) - Boult introduced a young pianist called Peter Katin. Many concerts conducted by Royalton Kisch!! He seems to have been eradicated from history! Sibelius 90th Birthday Concert - RPO Beecham Dec. 8th 1955. Beecham having fun with press photographers. Thomas Jenson - Nielson's 5th and Sibelius 6th, can't remember orchestra. (1958-9) 1st British performance of Robert Simpson 1st Symph and a Sym by Stanley Bate. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tickets</span> Red stripes for left hand stairs, and green for right. Beautiful appearance of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">organ</span>. Why is it so often covered up (concealed) including in photos and on the picture with this card? When I 1st saw the auditorium I was bowled over, and have continued to be so ever since!! Catering was better in the 50s than it is now.</p>
