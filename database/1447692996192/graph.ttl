Mer' at the RFH, unfortunately the orchestra score had not arrived and Gerald Moore stood in for the LSO.&nbsp; The radiant beauty of her singing, in a black dress, was unforgettable.&nbsp; I did not realise that I would never hear her sing again and her death (the following year?) was a personal blow to me - and still is.</p>"^^rdf:HTML;
