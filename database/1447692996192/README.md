<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I had heard Kathleen Ferrier&nbsp; at Wigmore Hall and had gone back-stage to speak to her.&nbsp; I was shy in the presence of a voice I had known from radio and records.&nbsp; My recollection of her was of the beauty of her eyes and her concentration on me.&nbsp; When she was performing the 'Poeme de L'Amour et de la (?) Mer' at the RFH, unfortunately the orchestra score had not arrived and Gerald Moore stood in for the LSO.&nbsp; The radiant beauty of her singing, in a black dress, was unforgettable.&nbsp; I did not realise that I would never hear her sing again and her death (the following year?) was a personal blow to me - and still is.</p>
