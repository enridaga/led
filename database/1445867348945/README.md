<p>Seeing Brian Wilson on stage in 2002 'Pet Sounds' tour was a dream come true. It was a magical evening which left me on a high for several days afterwards. The atmosphere was emotionally and electrically charged, the music brilliant ! The Beach Boys genius was back; the set was superb and I was hoarse by the end of the evening! And though I saw Briam Wilson again on the SMILE Tour at RFH (v.special too!) the 'Pet Sounds' session will always stand out in my memory as a truly unforgettable night - worth waiting all those years for. Thanks RFH.</p>
