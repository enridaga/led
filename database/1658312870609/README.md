This opened a scene of pleasure which continued many years. Music was my daily study and delight. But, perhaps, I laboured under greater difficulties than any one had done before me. I could not afford an instructor. I had no books, nor could I borrow, or buy; neither had I a friend to give me the least hint, or put my instrument in tune. Thus was I in the situation of a first inventor, left to grope in the dark, to find out something. I had first my ear to bring into tune, before I could tune the instrument; for the ear is the foundation of all music. That is the best tune, which best pleases the ear; and he keeps the best time, who draws the most music from his tune. </span></p>
