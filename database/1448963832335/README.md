<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">My first memory was of going to the Festival of Britain - the Skylon and drinking milk fresh from the cow! In 1954 and 55 my sister and I went regularly to the Ernest Read Children's Concerts on Saturday mornings which were a wonderful introduction to Classical Music - we loved them.</p>
