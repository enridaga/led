### comment


Henry Croswell (1840–93) kept a record of his visits to churches in London over a period of more than twelve years (1872–85).  He made methodical notes about the number of clergy, the churchmanship, the congregation, the sermon and the church architecture, as well as commenting on the music that he heard (the organ, the hymns and the choir).  The above listening experiences have been extracted from one of these records.

### comment


It is not known who transcribed Croswell’s diaries, or when.  The British Library record was created in 1960.  The pages are unnumbered, but most records are individually numbered.  Record numbers have therefore been used in place of page numbers, where available.  A further transcript of the diaries is held at the Bodleian Library.

<p class="MsoNormal">AN APPENDED NOTE from the Church Times - <u>The Bishop of Bedford and the City Churches</u> - Dr. Walsham How has during the last week paid them more frequent visits than we should think the Diocesan has vouchsafed to them for years [&hellip;] He has preached between Wednesday and Friday at St. Edmund the King, St. Mary, Aldermary; St. Michael, Cornhill; and S. Michael, Wood Street.&nbsp; This (latter) church is a striking example of how weekday congregations may be drawn together, although the Sunday attendance is meagre, though most probably owing to the pre-historic form of worship, of which the Bishop had a slight specimen.&nbsp; A number of unfortunate Charity boys are huddled together in an all-round pew, and a beadle, resplendent in gold lace, sits outside to keep them in order [&hellip;]&nbsp;The service on Friday was rendered by a choir at the western end of the church and the Bishop preached a practical sermon [&hellip;]&nbsp;the church was filled with the employ&eacute;s of the neighbouring houses of business.&nbsp;<br /> Dated 12/12/[18]79.&nbsp;</p>
