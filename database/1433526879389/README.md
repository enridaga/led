<p>Mutt never could play high, but he made Joe Oliver throw his trumpet away once. There was a big parade in new Orleans and Mutt was with the Tuxedo Brass Band, while Joe was with the Onward Brass Band. His outfit was a few feet in front of the Tuxedo Band in the parade, and Mutt was playing some grand stuff. Joe couldn't take it long. He just threw his horn away and went into a pawnshop and bought another.</p>
<p>Later on, in 1914 I should say, Joe began to improve a lot. He used to practice very hard. I remember once he told me that it took him ten years to a get a tone on his instrument. He used a half-cocked mute, and how he could make it talk! He played the variation style too; running chords I mean. His ear was wonderful--that helped a lot.</p>
