    I first saw Will Fyffe in the Pavilion Theatre. He had just made his big hit in London with ‘I Belong to Glasgow’ and he was billed as ‘The Great New Scottish Character Comedian’. He slew the audience. He was a bit like Harry Lauder, but didn’t have such a good voice. On the other hand, his character studies had more depths than Lauder’s.
    Fyffe seemed, though it seems odd to say it now, a modem comedian. His drunk man singing ‘I Belong to Glasgow’ was absolutely superb. James Agate put it perfectly when he wrote of Will Fyffe that he was not just impersonating a drunk — he was a drunk man trying to convince his hearers that he was sober.
Oddly enough, I can’t recollect now what his other songs were that night, but whatever he did was good, with the perfect timing of the real actor. And, though his voice was maybe not up to the Lauder standard, it was a good voice for the type of songs he sang. His patter was much better than Lauder’s, but that was because Lauder was still sticking to the same patter which he had used since the beginning of the century.
