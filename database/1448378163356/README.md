<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">My love of classical music was nurtured by the wonderful Robert Mayer children's concerts. We were brought by our High School in Streatham and regarded the occasions as great treats as they were the first outings available to us after the war. Always loved the gong when things were about to start - take your seats. I also remember seeing an exhibition tennis match in the shadow of the RFH, between Dan Maskell and Fred Perry - our heroes! All we ever saw were photographs - no TV then.&nbsp;</p>
