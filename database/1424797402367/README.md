<p>[Liszt] invited me... to a matinee he was going to give on Sunday for some countess of distinction who was here for a few days...He played five times, but no <em>great</em> work, which was a disappointment to me, particularly as the last three times he played duetts with a leading Weimar artist named Lassen, who was present. He made me come and turn the leaves. Gracious! how he <em>does</em> read! It is very difficult to turn for him, for he reads ever so far ahead of what he is playing, and takes in fully five bars at a glance, so you have to guess about where you <em>think</em> he would like to have the page over. Once I turned it too late, and once too early, and he snatched it out of my hand and whirled it back.&mdash;Not quite the situation for timorous me, was it?</p>
