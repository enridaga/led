<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">When I was about 12 years old in 1952, 13 in 1953, my parents allowed me to travel from Reigate in Surrey, by Greenline to London.&nbsp; They had bought me tickets for the Ernest Read concerts.&nbsp; These were concerts especially for children.&nbsp; Music was discussed and introduced before we heard it.I remember once looking up at a box and being told that Prince Charles and his Nanny were also attending.I enjoyed those concerts&nbsp; very much.&nbsp; I can't&nbsp; remember now how many years I attended but&nbsp; I have had a lifelong love of music, dating from those early days.</p>
