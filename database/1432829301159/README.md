This was the year of H.M. Queen Victoria's Jubilee, and preparations were
already being made for the due celebration of this event, to be held in the Abbey on June 21st. I had taken time by the forelock, and set some appropriate words as an anthem which possibly might be used on this occasion. H.M. The Queen had of course the selection of the music, and Canon Prothero suggested to Her Majesty that I should attend with some of the
choir at Osborne, to let her hear my anthem. The date selected for our visit was unfortunately the day of the unveiling of Professor Fawcett's Memorial. I took a few boys down to Osborne, and three of the Lay-Vicars. It was rather curious that one of them, Mr. Montem Smith, had as a boy sung at the funeral
of William IV. Besides the choral performance of my anthem before the Queen, one of the boys sang a solo from Gounod's "Redemption," and Mr. Hilton sang "Nazareth." I was presented to Her Majesty after the performance. She was very gracious, and signified her pleasure in the interpretations. 

A few days afterwards a letter came from Canon Duckworth, in which he said :
"Sir Henry Ponsonby told me last night that you may certainly consider that you have the Queen's permission to inscribe your Jubilee anthem to her. The Queen spoke to me of you and your party, and seems to have enjoyed your visit. She praised your anthem, and expressed her approval of Crook's singing." Crook was one of the boys, and a beautiful singer. It is sad to have
to record that only a few years later he developed consumption, and died.
