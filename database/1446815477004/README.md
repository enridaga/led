<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">A memorable moment was created for us when the RFH welcomed David Byrne to the stage in 2003. This was my husband's first outing after experiencing a severe accident and myself and his best friend gazed on as he sang his heart out to the song HOME, all of us entirely lifted and moved by the moment. The concert was a sensual celebration, enlivening emotions and compelling well behaved patrons to abandon their seats and dance.&nbsp;</p>
