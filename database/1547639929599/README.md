### comment


Henry Croswell (1840–93) kept a record of his visits to churches in London over a period of more than twelve years (1872–85).  He made methodical notes about the number of clergy, the churchmanship, the congregation, the sermon and the church architecture, as well as commenting on the music that he heard (the organ, the hymns and the choir).  The above listening experience has been extracted from one of these records.  On this occasion, Croswell recorded that his wife accompanied him to the service.
William Josiah Irons (1812–83) wrote hymns throughout his career.  With the organist Henry Lahee, he published The Metrical Psalter, for singing at each Sunday service throughout the year (1855) and an Appendix (1861), containing 22 hymns.  Later he published Hymns for Use in Church (1866), and Hymns for the Church (1873; enlarged as Psalms and Hymns for the Church, 1875; enlarged again 1883).  In the preface to the latter edition, he wrote: ‘The Organist of S. Mary Woolnoth, W.H. ESSEX, ESQ., has selected Music for this Book.  Tunes from the Works of H. LAHEE, ESQ., and of the REV. R.R. CHOPE, are used among us; and to DR. STAINER, of St. Paul’s, and others, my thanks are due.’

### comment


It is not known who transcribed Croswell’s diaries, or when.  The British Library record was created in 1960.  The pages are unnumbered, but most records are individually numbered.  Record numbers have therefore been used in place of page numbers, where available.  A further transcript of the diaries is held at the Bodleian Library.
