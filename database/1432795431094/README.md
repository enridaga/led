<p>In connection with seeking Turle's advice, I will venture to tell a story that reveals Dean Stanley in a new light, that of musical critic. Before being very long at the Abbey it fell to my lot to play the Dead March in "Saul." I played it as I had heard Hopkins and other musicians play it, but to my surprise found that the Dean was much disappointed by my performance. I took the opportunity of seeing him and asking him what was wrong. He said it did not sound like the Dead March in "Saul" which he had been accustomed to from Turle, nor at all like the Dead March as played by Dr. Buck, of Norwich, which he had heard some thirty years before. I could not help replying that I did not suppose it did sound like Dr. Buck's performance, as I had never heard that Dr. Buck was a capable organist, although an admirable teacher of boys, but promised to take the opportunity of asking Turle what his particular version was. This I did, and soon found that it included the introduction of some remarkable drum effects, which I had somewhat modified.then told the Dean that if he would come and hear me, I would play it again. He came into the Nave one evening, when I gave him a supply of drums far exceeding whatTurle had done (I must admit for that occasion only), and he wrote me a note saying he was quite satisfied. Since then I have played the Dead March many times, and fancy I am somewhat celebrated for my drum effects, although these, I am afraid, are not approved by some of my brother organists.</p>
