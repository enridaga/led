### value


<p>My husband and I attended a concert at the Festival Hall that remains unforgettable, Callas and a partner sang a wonderful selection of Italian and other songs.&nbsp; Callas looked elegant and posed as the great diva she was, and held the rapt audience throughout that charmed afternoon.</p>
