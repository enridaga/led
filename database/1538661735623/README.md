<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">My wife was a very religious woman. I was still an agnostic, but we never argued about religion. She became a member of a Congregational Church and the children attended the Sunday school. At supper she told me they were having a Womens&nbsp;<em>[sic]</em>Weekend, and said, &ldquo;Dare I ask you to sing at our concert?&rdquo; &ldquo;I would be very pleased. It is some time since I was on a concert platform&rdquo;, I replied. It was all arranged and I did my usual impersonations. During the evening one of the Deacons of the Church asked if I would care to sing at their &ldquo;Mens&nbsp;<em>[sic]</em>Weekend&rdquo; in two or three weeks time. I agreed, the audience seemed to enjoy the novelty of the impersonations.&nbsp;</span></p>
