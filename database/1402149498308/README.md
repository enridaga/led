As a child during the war, we were sheltered from the horrors of the blitz in the coastal holiday resort of Nairn. Towards the end of the war, we had German and Italian prisoners of war billeted in the town, in what were previously hotels. They seemed to be able to work locally helping out on farms. 
We had other strangers in our midst. The local agricultural society’s show ground was occupied by a large number of Indian troops. These were a mounted regiment, and they had many horses. I believe they trained in the surrounding district. 
The most memorable thing about these — to us exotic — troops was their hospitality. Every so often they would organise an At Home and provide a feast of curries, rice, chapatis and naan bread, all cooked in the open air. 
We were allowed to look at their wonderful horses too. After the meal a display of horsemanship would be put on, including pig-sticking. 
Occasionally, the Indian troops would put on a show in the local cinema on a Sunday night, when there would be singers, magicians and acrobats. I well recall that they always included the song 'I'll walk beside you', only they pronounced it 'I'll valk beside you'. 
This rendition was in honour of Major Alan Murray, usually in the audience, the composer of this song, who was also billeted in Nairn.

The BBC's WW2 People's War project ran from June 2003 to January 2006. The aim of the project was to collect the memories of people who had lived and fought during World War Two on a website; these would form the basis of a digital archive which would provide a learning resource for future generations. 
The target audience, people who could remember the war, was at least 60 years old. Anyone who had served in the armed forces during the war was, at the start of the project, at least 75. Most of them had no experience of the internet. Yet over the course of the project, over 47,000 stories and 14,000 images were gathered. A national story gathering campaign was launched, where 'associate centres' such as libraries, museums and learning centres, ran events to helped gather stories. Many hundereds of volunteers, many attached to local BBC radio stations, assisted in this. Read more about how the stories were gathered. 
The resulting archive houses all of these memories. These stories don't give a precise overview of the war, or an accurate list of dates and events; they are a record of how a generation remembered the war, 60 years of more after the events, and remain in the Archive as they were contributed. The Archive is not a historical record of events, a collection of government or BBC information, recordings or documents relating to the war..
