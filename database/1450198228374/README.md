<p class="MsoNormal">Jullien was performing a piece entitled <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Night</em> &mdash;I cannot now give the composer&rsquo;s name. At the beginning the audience was told, either orally or by printed notice, that there might be some startling effects, but no one need be afraid,&mdash;all would end well, etc. It is not a difficult task to compose an effective piece to be called <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Nigh</em>t with the assistance of a grand orchestra as the main factor, and given an opening of quiet, monotonous tones, like Felicien David&rsquo;s opening to his <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Desert</em>, a lullaby, a lover&rsquo;s serenade, and lots of such odds and ends, which any good man with a lively imagination can invent. At the Crystal Palace music of this sort was purring along and lulling people into reposeful security &mdash;all quiet as night should ever be&mdash;when suddenly the clang of real fire-bells was heard; people jumped from their seats; there was a big commotion ; fire and flames were seen apparently bursting from the roof of the Palace; ushers were rushing about telling people to sit down, for it was a part of the performance; the big doors were swung open, and in rushed two or three fire companies with their &ldquo;machines,&rdquo; hose, and great fire-ladders. These ladders were raised to the roof, and the firemen, in their traditional red flannel shirts and helmets, and carrying speaking-trumpets, climbed the ladders. Real water was squirted, glass was broken, cries, orders, every sort of noise concomitant of a fire was heard,&mdash;-plus the big orchestra, which was making a fearful din, sawing and blowing <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">fortissimo</em> through every possible diminished seventh that could be raked up out of the musical scale.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It lasted long enough to make the most tremendously red-peppered musical sensation that mortal ears ever heard.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It must be understood that all the previously distributed notices were not sufficient to prevent some timid souls from being alarmed. The noise and confusion created almost a panic. Some were fainting, others bursting with laughter, the cooler ones enthusiastically admiring the well-arranged piece. Finally, the fire was put out, the firemen with their machines retired, and the orchestra artistically prepared the audience for a song of praise and thanksgiving which came in the shape of <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Old Hundred</em> played and sung, and joined in by the well-pleased audience. It was a <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ne plus ultra</em> of realistic music</p>
