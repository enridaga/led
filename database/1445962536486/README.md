<p>I hadn't visited the Royal Festival Hall since living in London in the 60's and now, 1n 2005, I was drawn back from Devon with my wife to the Meltdown performance of the iconic Patti Smith performing the 30th anniversary of 'Horses', having last seen her at the Top Rank in Cardiff in 1977 or 78!In my early 60's I'm not a great one for leaping to my feet, but when she walked on the stage I was propelled upwards with hands above my head, standing with tears in my eyes.<br />Strange how over the years I've&nbsp; seen many of the greatest artists and performers who have been part of my life, but that was special, as was the energy, charisma, sheer guts and magnitude of her and her band's performance. It still seems pointless going to any more concerts now.</p>
