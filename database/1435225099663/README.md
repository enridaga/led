<p>After the [Fletcher Henderson] band would finish playin' at Roseland about one a.m., they'd sometimes play for dances in Harlem, till about three-thirty in the morning. There'd be a band on before Fletcher got there, but when he and the men arrived, everything would stop. Folks would get out of the way, and then Fletcher would start off with "Sugar Foot Stomp" and the crowd would go wild.</p>
<p>And there were no singers then like there are now. We didn't need 'em. Oh, Louis [Armstrong] would carry on with a lot of foolishness--jump up and down and shout like a down-South preacher. And Jimmy Harris was all fun and comedy too. He'd act like Bert Williams and sing "Somebody Loves Me" just like Williams--and things like that.</p>
