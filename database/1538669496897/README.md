<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">[Harry West details his love of organ music and learning to play, largely self-taught, in pages 28; 32 &ndash; 35 of his memoir, where Colston Hall is mentioned as a setting for listening to organ music at a Methodist service. He longed to play the organ from the age of six but his parents could not afford lessons. Listening experiences relating West&rsquo;s &lsquo;musical knowledge&rsquo; are included in the Listening Experience Database as separate items].&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">I must now once again return to an earlier date to pick up the line which led to my musical knowledge, such as it is. Somewhere around 1890 when I was 10 years of age, the [Old Market Street Methodist Men&rsquo;s Bible Class], of which my father was a member, built the Mission Hall in Barrow Road, Newtown, Bristol. They used there a very small harmonium without stops. (They later obtained a very good American organ). My father who was in the choir, purchased this small instrument for twenty-five shillings, and tried to learn to play it. Unfortunately he failed after a pretty persistent effort [due to poor eye sight].&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">One evening he realised that his efforts would be unavailing. He got off the stool, turned to me, a mere boy, and said &ldquo;Harry boy, it is no good, I shall never &lsquo;bust&rsquo; [organist] George Riseley&rsquo;s contract at Colston Hall. I will tell you all about the notes, their values etc., you see what you can do&rdquo;. I was delighted. We had no books of musical instruction, I could only do what my father had tried to do, that was to play tunes, or try to, from the &ldquo;Bristol Tune Book&rdquo;, &ldquo;Wesley&rsquo;s Tune Book&rdquo; and Sankey&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sacred Songs and Solos&rdquo;. I thought that if I could master that lot, I should be a competent musician. I did eventually master all of them, but in the course of it, failing professional instruction, I acquired some awkward habits of technique, which hampered me in more pretentious compositions. If I had waited until I could get professional instruction, however, I should never have learnt.&nbsp;</span></p>
