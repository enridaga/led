In this class there were all sorts of people, old and young, grey headed folks and children; but most of them were free people. After we had done spelling, we tried to read in the Bible. After the reading was over, the missionary gave out a hymn for us to sing. I dearly loved to go to the church, it was so solemn. I never knew rightly that I had much sin till I went there.&nbsp;</span></p>

### comment


Mary (Molly) Prince was born into slavery in Bermuda 1787/88. The listening experiences occur when she was about thirty years old and had begun attending the Moravian Church, Antigua. Her experience of enslavement on Bermuda, Grand Turk and Antigua, in domestic settings, plantation work and in salt ponds, was brutal, including regular severe beatings by those who enslaved her. Her health was severely affected. She married self-emancipated Daniel James on Christmas Day, 1826; two years later her ‘owners’ John Adams Wood Jr and his wife took Mary with them to England where, with the support of the Moravian Church and abolitionist sympathisers she left the Woods’ household and tried to gain her freedom. She was unsuccessful, and after producing her narrative, she disappears from the historical record. 

Mary Prince’s harrowing narrative was the first personal account of slavery published in Britain by an enslaved black woman. Its production was a collaborative effort. She narrated her experiences to amanuensis Susanna Strickland. Anti-slavery advocates Thomas Pringle and Joseph Phillips compiled, edited and published the account.
