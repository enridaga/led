<p>The Fair brings together many musicians. All the little bands from the surrounding country come to town to reap a little something during the harvest time. These bands are from four to eight or ten, perhaps, in number, and are variously composed as to instruments. Some of brass, some of strings, and some curiously mixed; as a horn, a clarionet, a violin, and a bassoon; or a double-bass, oboe, flute, and trumpet, &amp;c. As early as six o&rsquo;clock in the morning they are out, and are seen and heard playing in passage-ways, entrances to hotels, or wherever many people may be supposed to be within hearing; depending for remuneration upon the voluntary contributions of those to whose edification they play. They are almost all of them apparently very poor, and are contented with small gains; indeed, one would suppose that even without &ldquo;food and raiment&rdquo; they are content. They seem to enjoy it right well, and to take it for granted that others will like their music as well as they do themselves. Many females are seen with a very ordinary kind of harp in their hands; these unite into bands, and three or four are seen performing in chorus. Female violinists too, are often seen, and a harp and a violin are regarded as helps meet.</p>
