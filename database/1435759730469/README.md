<p>We could play all morning and half through the day if we wished to, and in fact we often did. The music was so good that I seldom got to bed before midday.</p>
<p>It was just such a late morning session that once had Coleman Hawkins hung up.&nbsp;[...]</p>
<p>The date must have been 1934 because Prohibition had been lifted and whisky was&nbsp;freely on sale.[...]</p>
<p>The word went round that Hawkins was in the Cherry Blossom, and within about half an hour there were Lester Young, Ben Webster, Herschel Evans, Herman Walder, and one or two unknown tenors piling in the club to blow.</p>
<p>Bean [Hawkins] didn't know the Kaycee [Kansas City] tenor men were so terrific, and he couldn't get himself together though he played all morning. I happened to be nodding that night, and around four a.m. I awoke to hear someone pecking on my screen.</p>
<p>I opened the window on Ben Webster. He was saying, "Get up, pussycat, we're jammin' and all the pianists are tired out now, Hawkins has got his shirt off and is still blowing. You got to come down."</p>
<p>Sure enough, when we got there, Hawkins was in his singlet, taking turns with the Kaycee men. It seems he had run into something he didn't expect.</p>
<p>Lester's style was light and [&hellip;] it took him maybe five choruses to warm up. But then he would really blow; then you couldn't handle him on a cutting session.</p>
<p>That was how Hawkins got hung up.</p>
