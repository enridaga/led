Scarcely a day passes but one church or other has to celebrate some festival, saint's anniversary, or other important holy rite, where music is an essential requisite; and fond as I am of sacred music in particular, I have hitherto missed few opportunities of that kind. In almost every instance the performers, both vocal and instrumental, were of the first-rate abilites, and the composition, whether ancient or modern, truly sublime; but frequently also the pleasure I experienced was alloyed, or rather destroyed, by sensations of disgust, felt at the sight of eunuchs employed in the execution of these sacred concerts. Among all the potent engines which the Catholic church has called in aid of the adoration of the Supreme Being, music, from its powerful and direct influence on our hearts and feelings, and the sublimity of its nature, deservedly claims the first rank. But, surely, the shrill and unnatural strains of these unfortunate beings, can add nothing to the solemn harmony of divine song; on the contrary, their employment debases that heavenly science, their presence contaminates the hallowed temples of the Almighty, and their introduction into a place of worship, bespeaks a most blasphemous and preposterous refinement of modern taste. </span></p>
