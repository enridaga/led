<p>On my first visit to the Hall, in May 1951, I was most struck by the large expanses of beautiful, glowing woodwork. I also recall the sense of wonder at standing in front of a huge glass wall only a matter of yards from the Hungerford Bridge, and yet being unable to hear the passing trains. The concerts which I attended during the London Festival of Britain Season (10 May - 30 June) were less than memorable; so it is fortunate that I still have the programmes to remind me! In spite of some better evenings later in the year, it was not until 1952, with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and concerts conducted by Cantelli and Karajan, that the Hall's full potential became clear. it is still my venue of choice!</p>
