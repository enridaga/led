<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I arrived with my husband and daughter of 4 yrs, just looking for somewhere to grab a quick cuppa before moving.&nbsp; We were instantly captivated by the live jazz music being played and the way that spontaneous outbreaks of dancing included all ages and cultures.&nbsp; We joined in, drank tea and left with a warm glow.</p>
