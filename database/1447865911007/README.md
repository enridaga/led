<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">Before the hall was opened, a friend who worked in the LCC took me to a test of acoustics where a series of piano, strings, brass were played followed by first a starter pistol then a revolver, a rifle and finally a huge shot gun, all followed by great applause and laughter. I have vivid memories of that occasion!&nbsp;</p>
