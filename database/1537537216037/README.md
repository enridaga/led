<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The Village feast, which took place on Corpus Christi Day was an important event in its life. Girls in service, and any native who could manage it, would come home for the Feast. The day started by a band coming to the village, which was met by the members of the Village Sick Benefit Society headed by a man carrying a banner. It was looked on as a great honour to carry the banner, and it required a strong man, especially if it was a windy day. Then with flag flying and band playing, we all marched to the church for a special service. [&hellip;] After the service, they marched up the village playing at the big houses, where refreshment was handed out until they came to the school.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the school, a good hot dinner was provided [&hellip;] After dinner, the band struck up again and they marched up the village, stopping to play at the big houses again, not forgetting the pubs. Dancing would take place on the lawns, and at each place, drink would be handed out.&nbsp; This continued till about 6pm, by which time&nbsp;[...] the band had got past playing and the man with the banner was staggering about. So it was time for the band to get in their horsebrake and depart to their own village.&nbsp;</span></p>
