### comment


The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border’ was edited by Sir Walter Scott, one of many Scottish literary figures to befriend Hogg and support his writing career. He contributed material to Scott’s publication. Hogg was self-educated and, like his mother, collected traditional Scottish ballads which form the bulk of his 1821 publication ‘The Mountain Bard; Consisting of Legendary Ballads and Tales … to which is prefixed a Memoir of the Author’s Life, Written by Himself’.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">In 1802, &ldquo;The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border&rdquo; came into my hands; and, though I was even astonished to find such exact copies of many old songs, which I had heard sung by people who never could read a song, but got them handed down by tradition&mdash;and likewise at the conformity of the notes to the traditions and superstitions, which are, even to this day, far from being eradicated from the minds of the people amongst our mountains&mdash;yet, I confess, I was not satisfied with many of the imitations of the ancients.&nbsp;</p>
