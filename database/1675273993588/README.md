<p>In Churches which have no Organs, or on Days in which they are not played, some Clerks find a great Difficulty in pitching the Tunes properly, for want of knowing their Compass of Voice: To such I would recommend the Use of a Concert Pitch-Pipe as a sure Guide, by which, though they do not understand Music, they might be taught, in one Hour, to begin every Tune in its proper Key, that is, so as not to go higher than E, or lower than D, which, indeed, should be the Compass of all Psalm-Tunes. The Method is so very easy, as well as useful, that I have taught it with great Success at several Charity-Schools, at which Places, though the Children could sing the Psalm-Tunes very well, yet they could not pitch them with any Certainty, till at my Request their Trustees had furnished them with Pitch-Pipes, and which they now constantly use, when they sing Psalms in their Schools, at Morning and Evening Prayer. This prevents the many Inconveniences which attend such as are not skilled in Psalmody, because it gives the very same Sound that an Organ should, and which none can mistake with a tolerable Ear.</p>
