The way in which I received the inspiration for this is deeply characteristic of the essence of artistic creation. For a long time I had been thinking of introducing the chorus in the last movement and only my concern that it might be taken for a superficial imitation of Beethoven made me procrastinate again and again. About this time Bülow died, and I was present at his funeral. The mood in which I sat there, thinking of the departed, was precisely in the spirit of the work I had been carrying around within myself at that time. The chorus in front of the organ intoned the Klopstock chorale “Auferstehn!” Like a flash of lightning it struck me, and everything became clear and articulate in my mind. The creator had been awaiting this flash, that is “the holy conception”. / Then I only had to create in sounds what I had experienced. And still, if I had not already been carrying this work inside of me, how could I have experienced this? Even though thousands were sitting with me: only when I experience do I “compose” – only when I compose do I experience. I know you will understand without my having to elaborate further. / The nature of a musician can hardly be expressed in words. It is much easier to say in what ways he differs from others. But as for what he is, perhaps he least of all should be allowed to elucidate this question. It is the same with his goals. He changes them, like a sleep-walker, to – he does not know what road he is taking (perhaps along dizzy precipices), but he goes toward the distant light whether it be an eternally shinning star or an enticing will-o’-the-wisp!
