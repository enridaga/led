<p>Music hath charms - at least some music is so reputed - and in December of 1915 a band in each divison was authorized; instruments were received and in an incredibly short time this 'diversion' marched out daily to our various billets where it discoursed sweet music. We found a private soldier who said he had once been a band sergeant; and he turned out trumps. He was full of enthusiasm and the technique of martial music; directing his corporal to march the band to its destination, while he walked behind at his ease. Musicians of every class competed to become members. The 'trombone' came in for a trial from a trench where he had been up to his waist in water and mud. Begrimed with mud he blew as if his life depended on it. When told that his kit would be sent for the on the next day, he hastily replied: 'No, I'll go and get it at once', fearing that the band selectors might change their minds. Our band played uncommonly well with but a fortnight's practice. So keen were the performers.</p>
