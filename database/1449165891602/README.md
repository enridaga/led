<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I came to concerts as a teenager with my parents soon after the hall opened. It was so new, modern and luxurious - all that space. We had never seen anything like it. In my physics studies at university in the later 1950's, the Royal Festival Hall was always quoted as an example of good acoustics.</p>
