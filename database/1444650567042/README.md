<p>I came here first as a student, aged 18, in 1963 - the Festival Hall represented everything exciting about London.&nbsp; For 3 shillings you could sit in the choir.&nbsp; I remember one of Segovia's last concerts, this figure on a stool in the middle of the vast stage.&nbsp; And walking across Hungerford Bridge composing poems.</p>
