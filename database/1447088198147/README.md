<p>We came to the pre-opening concert with my parents.&nbsp; My father, William Thomas Hall, was Secretary at the LCC to the architect who designed the Festival Hall.&nbsp; He worked for the LCC-GLC from the time he was 14 until he was 74&nbsp; (apart from World War 1 service).&nbsp; We have named choir seats for him and my mother and, look forward to enjoying many more visits with our children and grandchildren!</p>
