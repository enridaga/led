# Listening Experience 1392910602670

### comment


Busino's understanding of English was not perfect and it is clear that he experienced some difficulty in following the text of the masque. His account of the musical content is valuable, however, and the instruments he mentions, piffari, tromboni, and so on, would have been familiar to him from Venice.

### has_evidence_text


At about the 6th hour of the night the king appeared with his court…. On entering the house, the cornets and trumpets [sic.; this is an erroneous translation of Piffari et i Tromboni] to the number of fifteen or twenty began to play very well a sort of recitative, and then after his Majesty had seated himself under the canopy…he caused the ambassadors to sit below him on two stools, while the great officers of the crown and courts of law sat upon benches ...
Next followed twelve extravagant masquers, one of whom was in a barrel, all but his extremities, his companions being similarly cased in huge wicker flasks, very well made. They danced awhile to the sound of the cornets and trumpets [piffari, et tromboni] performing various and most extravagant antics.
