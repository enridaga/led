<p>The first time that I heard Freddie Keppard was in the course of a Breakfast Dance given by the Eighth Infantry Regiment at the corner of Thirty-fifth Street and Giles Avenue. The place could hold six to seven thousand people. I was astonished by the power of this musician. He played with assurance and more strongly than any other trumpet player I have ever heard. He was a great trumpet player, possessing a lot of rhythm and an exceptional quality of execution. His style was very different from that of [Louis] Armstrong. It was more lyrical. With his orchestra of eight musicians, Keppard succeeded in carrying everyone away. He made as much noise as the military brass band that opened up proceedings.</p>
