During [the residence of the Greatorex family in Leicester]... an incident occurred, which Mr. Greatorex used to tell with great humour. A soldier, passing through the minster-yard at midnight, to his great surprise heard the organ playing, which he mentioned on arriving at his quarters. As no one was inclined to believe his tale, the soldier backed his assertion with a wager, and the parties set out to determine the fact. On approaching the church, however, through the stillness of the night they were convinced that he had made a true report, for they heard the tones of the organ at a considerable distance. They repaired to the sexton, who reluctantly got up to investigate the matter, as he declared he left no one in the church when he locked up the doors. On entering the minster-yard, they all involuntarily stopped, and listened for a while, but heard nothing but the whispering wind in the trees. The sexton, enraged at being thus disturbed, was about to return, when the loud organ poured forth a sound so horrible, that this son of the church, terrified in the extreme, declined to lead the way, and it became a question who should move first. The sounds having ceased, they ventured to open the massive door, and just as they entered, an ominous growl burst forth and put them all to flight. One more courageous than the rest, thought he heard footsteps above. They cautiously mounted the stairs, when lo! John Strong, the blind weaver, presented himself. “Hey, John,” said the sexton, recovering from his fright, “how got you here ?” “Why I came in at prayers,” said John, “and hid myself in a pew, where I lay till I thought the whole of you were fast asleep, and I am plaguy mad that you have found me out.”
