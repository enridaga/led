<p>I first came to the Festival Hall when I was eight in 1953 with my father,&nbsp; for a classical music concert. We sat at the back of the orchestra, which was interesting. I then attended the Ernest Read children's concerts on a Saturday morning for several years. I still come to the Festival Hall from time to time, with my husband, children and now grandchildren.</p>
