To; The Chairman, BBC

Dear Sir

I am trying to listen appreciatively to the symphony concert now being broadcast from 2LO* but find it most difficult to do so.

The music is much too light & highbrow in style and the songs doleful & insipid in the extreme, 15 minutes of this sort of thing would be quite sufficient.  I venture to suggest that a long ? (illegible) [of] such music cannot be interesting to the majority of those who, like myself, hope for more enjoyable entertainment from 2LO programmes.  yours faithfully

This programme was broadcast on a Sunday, when programming as a whole had a religious focus.   2 LO refers to programmes broadcast from London and Daventry transmitter 5XX  The programme records tell us the following:
9.09pm Chamber Music: KUTCHER TRIO; MARGOT HINNENBERG-LEFEBRE (Sop.), acc. STEUERMANN.  (no details about the music itself).
