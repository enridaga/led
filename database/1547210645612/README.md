### comment


Henry Croswell (1840–93) kept a record of his visits to churches in London over a period of more than twelve years (1872–85).  He made methodical notes about the number of clergy, the churchmanship, the congregation, the sermon and the church architecture, as well as commenting on the music that he heard (the organ, the hymns and the choir).  The above listening experience has been extracted from one of these records.  The record is dated 27/4/77 in the transcript, but its position within the whole indicates that 27 May was intended.
‘The New Mitre-Hymnal’ (1875) was a new and smaller edition of William J. Hall’s popular ‘Psalms and Hymns adapted to the Services of the Church of England (1836), commonly known as the ‘Mitre Hymn Book’ after the bishop’s mitre embossed on the front cover.

### comment


It is not known who transcribed Croswell’s diaries, or when.  The British Library record was created in 1960.  The pages are unnumbered, but most records are individually numbered.  Record numbers have therefore been used in place of page numbers, where available.  A further transcript of the diaries is held at the Bodleian Library.
