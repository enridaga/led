My mother, when at home, had the radio on in the background all day with music and talk. It featured so largely in our lives. Whenever possible I listened to plays, shows and musical programmes. Workers Play Time, Forces Favourites, Tommy Handley and ITMA, Henry Hall and his band and all the big American Jazz bands. My younger sister, Sylvia, intent on disrupting the end of a play to spoil it for me, would regularly interrupt the drama. No amount of pleading helped â€” she made every noise she could to drown the radio. Often I had to read the play to find out how it ended. 
later....
Growing older, I was allowed to attend dances at the Rotherham Town Hall where a Canadian swing band entertained and the girls could hardly contain themselves when the Glenn Miller and Frank Sinatra songs were played. Tapping our feet and swaying to the rhythms we longed for and hoped some lovely airman would swing us into action on the dance floor. We tried every dance, learned the new steps, and prepared to be carried away on cloud nine. On one occasion I wore a long, home made, blue gown, modelled on a famous film star's dress. The band struck up 'Alice Blue Gown'; I was taken into the arms of a very strong Canadian Airman to dance - and was so flattered! 
There was also a very talented young Canadian pianist who played the most amazing boogie-woogie music. It was almost mesmerizing. I often wondered what happened to him in the war.

### comment


The BBC's WW2 People's War project ran from June 2003 to January 2006. The aim of the project was to collect the memories of people who had lived and fought during World War Two on a website; these would form the basis of a digital archive which would provide a learning resource for future generations. 
The target audience, people who could remember the war, was at least 60 years old. Anyone who had served in the armed forces during the war was, at the start of the project, at least 75. Most of them had no experience of the internet. Yet over the course of the project, over 47,000 stories and 14,000 images were gathered. A national story gathering campaign was launched, where 'associate centres' such as libraries, museums and learning centres, ran events to helped gather stories. Many hundereds of volunteers, many attached to local BBC radio stations, assisted in this. Read more about how the stories were gathered. 
The resulting archive houses all of these memories. These stories don't give a precise overview of the war, or an accurate list of dates and events; they are a record of how a generation remembered the war, 60 years of more after the events, and remain in the Archive as they were contributed. The Archive is not a historical record of events, a collection of government or BBC information, recordings or documents relating to the war..
