<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I was taken by my Granny, when the Festival Hall was quite new, to see a ballet performance of Beatrix Potter's stories. I remember Jeremy Fisher leaping around on stage. It was an exciting outing for me to go up to London and see the Thames and the impressive new big buildings.</p>
