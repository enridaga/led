I have been att several of their comedies, and Tragedies, which come for Short of ours, they having no Songs, dances, or variety of Scenes, the Actors are generally in the Same to me, wanting due passion and motion; they have very little to set them of but their fine clothes, which are extraordinary rich and without deceit: Their Operas much surpass ours, both in their clothes, scenes, singing, dancing, Musique the last of which is really incomparable; and has made me wish for your company here, knowing you to be a very good judge, and much delighted with it;&nbsp;The Italians who were very excellent this way, were banished Paris, for representing in their Operas the amours of the King with Madam Maintenon; which has deprived this city of a great pleasure, but it is dulted, as if the King will give them permission to reside here again.</span></p>
