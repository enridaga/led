<p>His [Eddie lang's] mentality could be termed a natural one, as he carried the entire Paul Whiteman library, as far as his parts were concerned, on the back of a small business card in his coat breast pocket. There would be some intricate modulation to play, and rarely in radio rehearsals would he have time to actually set these things, so Whiteman would say, "You take the modulation Eddie." During the programme that night, just before the modulation, the excitement of the entire band could be felt because it hadn't been rehearsed and the boys were wondering if Eddie remembered. All Eddie had was a few marks on that little card--marks that meant nothing to anyone but Eddie himself.</p>
<p>Came the modulation--and the master played it from another world. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief and from that day on, when Eddie would say, "I got it", everyone realized he knew what he was talking about.</p>
<p>Evidence of his genius can he heard on all of our early Okeh recordings, as Eddie did practically all of them. Too many, in fact, for me to recall here in detail. Those of you who are acquainted with the recordings will recall a masterful lick that would do credit to present-day records. Inseparable with Joe Venuti, the early recordings stand to prove that these two great artists presented guitar and violin masterpieces that will live forever as the ultimate for such a combination.</p>
