William Hazlitt completed the memoir using Holcroft’s diary, notes and other papers, adding commentary. Hazlitt explains in the introduction to volume 1, ‘Mr. Holcroft had intended, for several years before his death, to write an account of his life […] I first became acquainted with Mr. Holcroft about ten years ago; my chief intercourse with him was within the last three or four years of his life’.

I approached the church door, found it open, and went in, when I found my ear charmed with some heavenly addition to the sweet melody of music; and on inquiry was told, they were singing in four parts. At the head of them was a Mr. Langham, who could sing in a feigned soprano&rsquo;s voice, and who was their instructor in music [&hellip;] and each of them paid him five shillings a quarter for his trouble in teaching them. Having stood with delight to listen some time, a conversation at length began, I was invited to try my voice, and after a ready compliance, both my voice and ear were pronounced to be good.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus encouraged, I ventured to ask if I might come among them; and was answered, yes; they should be very glad to have me, for they much wanted a treble voice [&hellip;] Langham, who had great good-nature, said, since I was but a boy, and my wages could not be great, he would give up the entrance money [and thus] I should be instructed by him in the art of psalmody.&nbsp;</span></p>"^^rdf:HTML;
