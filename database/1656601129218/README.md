### comment


Thomas Holcroft had a remarkable memory and a great hunger for learning, including literacy, numeracy, singing, violin and was an able, clever stableboy at this time.  Langham also instructed Holcroft in mathematics and ‘was a maker of leather breeches, which were worn through all Newmarket’ (p. 147). Holcroft studied in earnest John Arnold’s Church Music Reformed, Or The Art of Psalmody Universally Explained Unto All People, 1765 when he learned to sing.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">One day as I happened to be passing the church, I heard voices singing, which exercise I admired; and having, as I thought, a tuneful voice, I was desirous of becoming acquainted with so pleasing an art. I approached the church door, found it open, and went in, when I found my ear charmed with some heavenly addition to the sweet melody of music; and on inquiry was told, they were singing in four parts. At the head of them was a Mr. Langham, who could sing in a feigned soprano&rsquo;s voice, and who was their instructor in music [&hellip;] and each of them paid him five shillings a quarter for his trouble in teaching them. Having stood with delight to listen some time, a conversation at length began, I was invited to try my voice, and after a ready compliance, both my voice and ear were pronounced to be good.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus encouraged, I ventured to ask if I might come among them; and was answered, yes; they should be very glad to have me, for they much wanted a treble voice [&hellip;] Langham, who had great good-nature, said, since I was but a boy, and my wages could not be great, he would give up the entrance money [and thus] I should be instructed by him in the art of psalmody.&nbsp;</span></p>

### comment


The first half of volume 1 was written by Thomas Holcroft, covering only the first sixteen years of his life. William Hazlitt completed the memoir using Holcroft’s diary, notes and other papers, adding commentary. Hazlitt explains in the introduction to volume 1, ‘Mr. Holcroft had intended, for several years before his death, to write an account of his life […] I first became acquainted with Mr. Holcroft about ten years ago; my chief intercourse with him was within the last three or four years of his life’.
