<p>Rev. Mr. Villiers, the clergyman of this parish, is not only a very popular, but a very excellent and evangelical preacher; he has a large congregation, and the service throughout, on Sabbath last, was highly interesting. Of course the common Episcopal liturgy is used. The psalms are read, but at the end of each psalm, as is very common here, the Gloria Patri is chanted. The Canticles are chanted; though this day the &ldquo;Jubilate Deo&rdquo; was sung in anthem form by the whole congregation. The music was very plain, and rather quick; that is, about as quick as it is convenient to speak the words and observe a distinct and solemn utterance. This Congregational anthem singing is not common, though it is quite practicable. The Canticles were chanted by the whole people, and quite well done. Cadences no slower than the utterance of the words on the chanting note. Both the chanting and the anthem singing this morning afforded sufficient proof of the practicability of these forms of music in congregations; but it must be understood that the anthem was, as we have already said, very plain. We know of but very few sufficiently plain, contained in our American singing books. Two metrical psalms were sung, both well done &mdash; everybody taking a part. The organ was not very well played; the organist seeming rather to adapt himself to choir than to Congregational singing, and making too much variation of stops and of piano and forte in different stanzas. The introductory voluntary was not more than three minutes in length, and there were no interludes between the stanzas of the hymns.</p>
