### comment


The Spitalfields Festival has been, since 1976, a major professional music event in the East End of London. Listening experiences relate to the Festival’s Education and Community Programme (ECP), launched in 1989. Education projects with schools and local community reflect these groups’ concepts and practices of the arts. The ECP is collaborative, linking musicians, writers and visual artists and the Spitalfields Festival with East End of London children, adults and elderly people.
