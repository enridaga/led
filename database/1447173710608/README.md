### value


<p>I came with my class from school in Edgware. As I lived in Wembley I came by myself on the underground to the Saturday morning classical concerts. My mother knew I was safe because it was the Royal Festival Hall where I would meet my class. I wore my purple school uniform with white cotton socks and a purple beret and gloves. I was aged 11. I still love classical concerts.</p>
