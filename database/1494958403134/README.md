<p>First of all, forgive me for not having come to see you after the concert to congratulate you on your fine success - so well deserved. / There were too many people, it was late, and I wanted to get home quickly to my dinner. So I am writing to let you know all the pleasure it gave me to hear your music. Primarily, it brought home to me how greatly compositions gain from being presented in a concert&nbsp;<em>devoted&nbsp;</em><em>to a single composer&nbsp;</em>(which I have very often noted in relation to exhibitions of paintings as well). The&nbsp;<em>festival&nbsp;</em>is really the best and most logical of concert forms, with all due respects to Machabey who said with regard to me: 'A composer has only "one style", which is why festivals are often so monotonous.'/ I do not know whether you have one style or several, but I do know that your works were set off to advantage by their very proximity to each other, whether or not there were contrasts (in fact, I loathe those symphony concert programmes where they switch for no reason from Beethoven to Debussy). Moreover, when presented with works by the same musician, one gradually becomes aware of the personality of that musician; and one realizes that there is in fact a&nbsp;<em>Poulenc style</em>, and that you know how to be, sincerely and simply,&nbsp;<em>yourself</em>. / You prove, by several of these pieces, that one can compose lively, sensitive, moving and personal works using a musical vocabulary that is common to everyone. I am happy to see thus confirmed a theory that I have always maintained. / If perhaps I do not like everything equally in that collection of songs,&nbsp;<em>I conclude with pleasure</em> that one always knows they are by&nbsp;<em>Poulenc&nbsp;</em>and that they are above all music. Which gives me much pleasure in these fleeting times. I particularly enjoyed the first collection, and above all the third, then the latest works (those performed for the first time), and lastly the intense and noble emotion of 'Les Ponts de C&eacute;' in which breathes the very soul of our wounded Fatherland. I must add that Bernac was incomparable as were you in your role of accompanist. Mme Balguerie has a beautiful voice and is very gifted, but there is in Bernac, together with a prodigious diversity of vocal colour, a precision of accent, an impeccable diction, a discreet mastery which I find clearly superior./ I could have said all this to you in two words in the middle of all the crowds, but I wanted to write it to you, however hastily. Once again, my congratulations, and believe me to be your affectionately devoted.&nbsp;</p>
