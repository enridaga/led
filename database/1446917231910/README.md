<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">Although I've been enjoying music and other events at the RFH for many years, I've chosen a memory from the new millenium which represents, for me, the variety, vibrancy and vitality - not to mention audacity - of the venue's range of 'entertainment'.&nbsp; Specifically I've chosen a mini-meltdown hosted by David Thomas and entitled 'Disastodrome' for its mixture of insanity + sheer brilliance.&nbsp; An awesome 'Mirrorman' was a highlight of my years of listening.</p>
