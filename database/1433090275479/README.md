### has_evidence_text


An interesting visitor to the organ-loft put in an appearance during the War, while I was playing the voluntary after service. An officer came up the stairs, and stood by me. As I finished, he asked me to play Bach's G minor Fugue, saying he was devoted to music, and to this great specimen of organ music in
particular. I excused myself on the plea that I was tired, and should have to practise it a little beforehand. He could not conceal his disappointment, and
answered that he was off to the Front the following day, and would have liked to hear his favourite work for the instrument. At this, I said, "Well, if you
come back, and are able to tell me that you've killed ten Germans, I'll play you the Fugue any day." Some months later, while I was away in Scotland, the
same officer re-appeared in the organ-loft, considerably to the surprise of my assistant, and inquired for me, explaining that he had come to ask me to redeem my promise. "But," said my assistant, " have you, on your part, killed those Germans?" The reply was quiet, but forceful: "I don't know about that, but I'm going to Buckingham Palace to-morrow to receive the V.C." ! He heard that Fugue.
