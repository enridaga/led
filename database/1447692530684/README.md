<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;I remember a time when there were no seats on either side of the performance area and as a schoolgirl I would sit on the floor and have my first taste of concert going with a huddle of others.&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; I remember watching Benjamin Britten's face as he sat in the Royal Box listening to Dennis Brain playing his piece for Horn, Tenor and Strings and improvising&nbsp; making Britten smile. &nbsp; 3)&nbsp; I remember Britten and Poulenc playing a double piano concerto (? did Poulenc write one?) and enjoying each other's companionship and playing so clearly, as one master to another.</p>
