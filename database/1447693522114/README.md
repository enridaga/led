<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I was at school in the 50s (Leyton County High for Girls) and we were given tickets for the Saturday morning childrens' concerts. This was the start of my ongoing affair with the RFH! I have since been to nearly all the jazz from 5.15pm+ in the foyer, on a table for 6-8 of us near the front.&nbsp; I've also been to the People's Palace restaurant, and cafeteria. I am looking forward to the re-opening.&nbsp;</p>
