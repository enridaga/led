<p>Saturday 8th October 1994. I had decided at the last moment to try and get a ticket to see Shirley Bassey. I think it was my first concert at the Royal Festival Hall. Despite the simple staging and lack of theatrical effects Miss Bassey overwhelmed the place and enthralled the audience with her glittering presence. It was marvellous to hear the legendary Bassey classics such as 'Goldfinger' coupled with new songs including ones from 'Sunset Boulevard'. Two years later I persuaded friends to join me for another Bassey concert. They thoroughly enjoyed the evening but what I remembered most was sipping champagne outside on the terrace, feeling like I was on a luxury ocean liner. Fabulous!</p>
