He was home on holiday from Kenya. He sat in the front row in full view of&nbsp;the choir. I was twelve at the time and I felt this was a good time to be in full voice.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The next day when I came home from school&nbsp;I&nbsp;was astonished to hear that he had been to the post office to ask Mother if my voice was being trained to which Mother replied no such thing had been thought of. Not having persuaded Mother to agree that it should be trained he asked if he could help to pay for lessons and even went as far as to offer to take me back to Kenya to see to it himself.&nbsp;</span></p>

Father thought that the young man had some ulterior motive and I felt that I had missed some great adventure but the matter was closed with warning not to repeat a word of what had been said.&nbsp;</span></p>

### comment


The unpublished memoir of Ethel M. Clark (nee Williams, b. 1909) focuses mainly on her rural childhood in the early twentieth century. It was probably written in the 1970s. It is held in The Burnett Archive of Working Class Autobiographies, gathered together by John Burnett, David Vincent and David Mayall whilst compiling their three-volume annotated bibliography, ‘The Autobiography of the Working Class’ (Harvester Press, 1984-1989).
