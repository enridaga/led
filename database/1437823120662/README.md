Being in love with a lady of the Court, who reciprocated his attachment, he gave out that he would depict upon his violin a Scene Amoureuse; the treble string, we presume, was the lady, and the fourth string the gentleman. The emotional dialogue was carried on between the two in a manner which fairly overcame the audience with delight, and led to the GRAND DUCHESS requesting him to try one string alone next time. How he succeeded in that exploit is known to all the world, for he ever afterwards retained an extreme partiality for the fourth string.</span></p>
