 - <p>I remember my sister bringing me here as small child - from Barnsley, Yorkshire. I saw my first proper ballet here - "London Morning" - was enchanted. Also brought schoolchildren here when I taught in Hitchin and Stevenage in the late 60s. Loved the Gamelan workshop with a musicologist called Duncan. Now come a lot as I live in London.</p>
