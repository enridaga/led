### comment


Editor Jeff Horton writes: 'Sam was invited to join Elmore's peripatetic group as one of a revolving cast of studio and road drummers on the "Chittlin' Circuit." This was the name given to the loose route that black R&B and blues bands traveled in the 1950s and 1960s, mostly through the Deep South and as far north as Pittsburgh and Detroit. It involved moving from gig to gig in automobiles stuffed with instruments and luggage, and it was a hardscrabble existence for musicians who relied on word of mouth to persuade the next club or theater owner to book them for a night or two. Many owners would even pit one band against another in competitions to see who the crowd wanted to have back again.â€™

In addition, Sam Myers appeared on many hit records with Elmore James. Their association lasted until 1963, when Elmore passed away from a heart attack at the age of forty-five.

<p>Starting off in 1952, Elmore [James] was paying me thirty-five dollars a night, playing drums. During the whole time we worked together, I didn't blow much harp, which is what a lot of people look for me to do now, every time when they see me. I didn't blow harmonica on but two of his recordings. One was a big classic by him, "Look on Yonder Wall." That was on Fire and Fury, Bobby Robinson's label out of New York. We did that one in New Orleans. I played with him from '52 until '63, the time when he died.</p>
<p>"Dust My Broom" was actually a Robert Johnson song, but Elmore had made it into his own by the way he played it, all electrified. It was a big record for him. Big Bill Hill and his brother had a cleaners and a booking agency, Colt's Booking Agency, on Madison Street. Big Bill was a disc jockey and used to do his show from there at the cleaners, through radio station WOPA. A lot of the bluesmen who he booked would have shows on that station. From there he would be playing their records from time to time[, &hellip; t]hey called that "breaking their records," playing their records when they just came out. That's how a lot of them got started.</p>
