<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I have very happy memories of the Royal Festival Hall. As&nbsp; a child I attended the Ernest Read Concert for Children which I really enjoyed.&nbsp; I also sang with my school choir, at the Christmas and Easter concerts with Ernest Read. They were excellent and great fun. I have also seen ballet and attended many concerts.&nbsp;</p>
