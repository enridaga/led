Wonderful Adventures of Mrs Seacole in Many Lands

### comment


Mary Jane Seacole (nee Grant, 1805 – 1881), the daughter of a Jamaican woman and a Scottish soldier, was an intrepid traveller, businesswoman, a pioneering nurse/healer and heroine of the Crimean War, known throughout the region as Mother Seacole. When the War Office refused her request to nurse soldiers in the Crimea, she travelled independently, establishing the British Hotel near Balaclava to provide shelter, food and convalescence. She risked her life to nurse the wounded on battlefields. She was supported and celebrated on her return to London after the war, ill and destitute, including a fund-raising festival (1857) attracting thousands of people. Her portrait (1869) is displayed at the National Portrait Gallery London. Her legacy--neglected for over a century—has been recovered. She was posthumously awarded the Jamaican Order of Merit in 1991, and a statue of Seacole was erected in 2016 in the grounds of St Thomas’ Hospital, London, among other honours.

<p style="margin: 9pt 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The news of the evacuation of Sebastopol soon carried away all traces of yesterday&rsquo;s fatigue. For weeks past I had been offering bets to every one that I would not only be the first woman to enter Sebastopol from the English lines, but that I would be the first to carry refreshments into the fallen city.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 9pt 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">[&hellip;]</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 9pt 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">When I found that strict orders had been given to admit no one inside Sebastopol, I became quite excited; and making my way to General Garrett&rsquo;s quarters, I made such an earnest representation of what I considered my right that I soon obtained a pass [to enter the Redan and Sebastopol].&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 9pt 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">[&hellip;]&nbsp;&nbsp;I can give you no very clear description of its condition on that Sunday morning, a year and a half ago. Many parts of it were still blazing furiously&mdash;explosions were taking place in all directions&mdash;every step had a score of dangers; and yet curiosity and excitement carried us on and on. I was often stopped to give refreshments to officers and men, who had been fasting for hours. Some, on the other hand, had found their way to Russian cellars; and one body of men were most ingloriously drunk, and playing the wildest pranks. They were dancing, yelling, and singing&mdash;some of them with Russian women&rsquo;s dresses fastened round their waists, and old bonnets stuck upon their heads.</span></p>
