I remember seeing Tricky around +/- 2000. It was a great concert and the Festival Hall was a good venue for it, contrasting in its elegance with Tricky's rougher style. I also saw the French rapper MC Solaar in the last year or so, and thought it was wonderful that the audience responded so well to someone singing in another language.
