### comment


The listeners' letter refers to attending the afternoon performance of 'On Spital Fields' on 22 June 2005, and strongly suggests that they have also watched the subsequent DVD of the performance.

The aim of the ‘On Spital Fields’ project was to devise, rehearse and perform a community cantata involving older people, adults and children from Tower Hamlets and a team of professional musicians and animateurs. The twelve pieces comprising the cantata tell the story of Spitalfields, based on fictional texts and historical documents relating to East End London. Makers included composer Jonathan Dove, librettist Alasdair Middleton, Gerry Cornelius conductor and Clare Whistler, director. Pupils from Osmani and St Anne’s primary schools and Mulberry School for Girls formed the children’s choirs (pupils from additional local schools participated in workshops to develop the project). Also performing were the Wessex Singers (Tower Hamlet’s choir for the over 50’s), The Joyful Company of Singers, an SATB choir and a community chorus, students from the Royal Academy of Music and Chroma Ensemble. The Society of Royal Cumberland Youths rang the bells of Christ Church, Spitalfields, its completed restoration celebrated by ‘On Spital Fields’, before both evening performances on 22 and 23 June 2005. 

Dove’s score is dedicated to Christopher Robert Vaughan (1961-1999), a passionate supporter of Spitalfields Festival. Vaughan left a legacy that helped to fund ‘On Spital Fields’. The community cantata was intended to celebrate Vaughan’s life.

<p>[Letter dated 29 July 2005]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Our thanks for the two DVDs received for Sue, Dennis and ourselves. I remember saying on the evening of the performance that if I could see &ldquo;On Spital Fields&rdquo; again, I would enjoy it even more. Lo and behold we have just that&mdash;something that we can treasure for the rest of our lives and imagine that we are sitting in the gallery at Christ Church.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">It was a wonderful day, not only the weather, but meeting Christopher&rsquo;s friends and seeing the result of some of his dreams come true. Again our sincere thanks to you and all the people who put so much into the production.&nbsp;</span></p>
