### comment


Henry Croswell (1840–93) kept a record of his visits to churches in London over a period of more than twelve years (1872–85).  He made methodical notes about the number of clergy, the churchmanship, the congregation, the sermon and the church architecture, as well as commenting on the music that he heard (the organ, the hymns and the choir).  The above listening experience has been extracted from one of these records.
The ‘Congregational Hymn Book’ refers to the ‘New Congregational Hymn Book’ of 1859, (enlarged with a supplement in 1874, and subsequently issued in an abridged version in 1876) a publication of the Congregational Church (the City Temple was an independent non-conformist church).  A tune-book was compiled by Adam Wright in 1861.  Various other tune-books were also used in Congregational churches at the time of Croswell’s visit.

### comment


It is not known who transcribed Croswell’s diaries, or when.  The British Library record was created in 1960.  The pages are unnumbered, but most records are individually numbered.  Record numbers have therefore been used in place of page numbers, where available.  A further transcript of the diaries is held at the Bodleian Library.
