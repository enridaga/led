<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">[The text, originally written in Italian, is constructed as a dialogue between Annibal and Guazza, concerning the art of conversation] </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Annibal: </span></em><span style="font-family: Arial;">I am entirely of your Mind; and that from hence it is, that we are very often mightily taken with Song, and think it written in a pure Vein of Poetry, when we hear it sung to the Violin by a good Voice; and yet, when we come to read it afterwards, we find it the most insipid Thing imaginable. Thus it often befalls those, whose Manner of talking may please very well; but set them to writing, and they are mere Dolts. And this we shall not wonder at, when we consider, that these Persons are not really eloquent, and that all their Excellence lies in an agreeable Delivery of their Words, which tho&rsquo; they are not properly ranged, nor expressive, nor sententious, yet they delight the Ear with a Sort of an harmonious Jingle; with which our Senses are so captivated, that we neither enquire after, nor desire any Thing farther. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">[The dialogue moves on to consider &lsquo;the Rules prescribed by the Authors of Rhetorick&rsquo;] </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">[&hellip;]</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Annibal:</span></em><span style="font-family: Arial;"> We are then to consider, that the first Part of Action consists in a Regulation of the Voice, which ought to measure its Strength, and so to modulate itself, that when there is Occasion to strain it to a higher Pitch than ordinary, yet that it offend not the Ear by too sharp or too harsh a Sound; like the Strings of musical instruments when they are not in Tune, or ill played upon. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">[&hellip;]</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Annibal:</span></em><span style="font-family: Arial;"> Lastly; the Voice must neither be faint and drawling, like that of a sick Man, or a Beggar; nor yet shrill and loud, like that of a Crier, or of a Schoolmaster, who rehearses to his Scholars some Theme or Lesson. For, if you do, it shall be said of you, as it was of one, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">If you sing, you sing badly; and if you read, you sing. </em></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Guazzo:</span></em><span style="font-family: Arial;"> But yet I can&rsquo;t think you would have us always keep one Tone and Measure. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Annibal:</span></em><span style="font-family: Arial;"> No, in Truth; for the Pleasure of Speech, as well as of Music, proceeds from the Change of the Voice; nay more (to conclude the Subject) I must acquaint you, that as we sometimes stand, sometimes walk, sometimes sit, without continuing long in either of these Postures, so the change of Voice, like an Instrument of divers Strings skilfully touched, is very acceptable, and a Relief to the Hearer and the Speaker. </span></p>
